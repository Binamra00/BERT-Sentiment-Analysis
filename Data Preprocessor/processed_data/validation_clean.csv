"yeah , right . i spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off . it was horribly boring , and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction . then the hero comes into the picture . born as an asian , but when he grew up , he became white . obviously white . he was not even close to passing for asian . he looked like justin timberlake . it was extremely distracting , and the story did nothing to help the cause . pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue . it's an hour and forty five minutes long , and by the end i was trying to eat my own face . i watched this because people at the video store where i work are always asking me if this movie is any good . now i have an answer . it goes something like this : ahem . ""no ! good god no ! it's horrible ! don't do this to yourself ! i would recommend another movie , perhaps one that is entertaining . """,0,2
"the clich of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment . pity a splendid cast , acting to the limits of their high talents , cannot redeem 'the return of the soldier' from its stiff-collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement . best moments , as another reviewer noted , come when glenda jackson is on screen; but even jackson's crackling good cinematic power cannot pull this film's chestnuts from its cold , never warmed hearth . ann-margret , she of sex-kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability , finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh-flawless middlesex accent . the hackneyed score , redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries' slathered-on saccharine emotionalism , is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script , blocking , and overbaked formalism of the direction; except for its score and corseted script and direction , 'the return of the soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together .",0,3
"horrible ending - and i cannot believe moore spent a year coming up with it . smacks of l . ron hubbard and dianetitcs , which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3 . 5 years . now , the first 1 . 5 hours were action packed , though absurd in the premise , and then it deteriorated into a slow , painful , sophomoric dissolution of the series . unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . were we to think more deeply ? if i wanted a lesson in a-materialism , i would reread daniel quinn's ishmael . absurd to think 38k people would give up everything for a ""fresh start"" . absurd to throw in a disappearing kara , and a reappearing baltar and six . absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve . just absurd .",0,2
"the story of the boy thief of bagdad ( as it was once spelled ) has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924 , who starred douglas fairbanks in the first , silent , rendering of ""thief of bagdad , "" to less imposing , more recent attempts . the best , however , remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling , magical panoply of top quality special effects . those effects still work their charm . no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief , abu , john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch , ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier , jaffar , played by a sinister conrad veidt . the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram . ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent , he and the boy , abu , suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates . ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt . their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work . two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl : lawrence w . butler and tom howard . ( howard , incidentally , did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film . both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry . ) duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting . justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses . sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good . for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there is a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind . still , i do not think anyone under eight ought to see ""thief of bagdad . "" this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present . it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them . ""thief of bagdad"" is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases . this is one of the best of its kind . 9/10 .",1,9
"it's not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery , or microbiology , or a booger-flicking tournament . instead , like every other rocky/flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market , it is about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness , rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course . ronald reagan top to bottom , in short; so as a piece of cinema it is down to the details . some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest , brought to you by none other than mr . keanu reeves , warming up for ted; heroine olivia d'abo's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates , one of whom appears to be made of porcelain . it's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys , but on the other hand at least they are in the movie . but d'abo does not quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick , and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it is all just bodies hurtling around , and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion , it is all performed by an obvious double .",0,3
"another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930's , resurrected by the magic of dvd . starring stock universal player lionel atwill ( often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies ) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket . one kills the victims ( stockbrokers involved in a scam ) and asks witnesses for the exact time , while the other is deaf and is proved ""innocent"" because he could not have spoken to witnesses . of course , where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness , would not they both be deaf ? oh , well . atwill does a pretty good job here , faking being deaf and mute . unfortunately , no one else here can really act worth a darn .",0,2
"astounding . . . . . this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie , but i sure enjoyed it . that last man who commented is a fool , this movie was one of a kind , and the music dark , jerry goldsmith himself , would had applaud this movie . great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film . i collect horror movies and soundtracks , so listen to what i have to say , not that other idiot . there is only one thing that do not fascinate me , the endings . according to prophecy it is all inaccurate , including final conflict , and left behind . but my conclusion being . . . . there great movies . . . and should be seen , before the great depression falls upon us , and before the democrats take over the presidency too . so signed . . . . jacob eder . . . a farmer , with a mastermind .",1,10
"this motion picture has a steady , haunting pace backed up with great acting ( one of chamberlain's best performances ) and a story that is revealed to us over time . beyond that , the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy , cautious and somber tone . weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals , their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous . although they are unrelated in story as well as genre , this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's ""lathe of heaven"" ( 1980 ) . ""the last wave"" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments . remember , ""hacking and slicing"" does not make a film a horror movie , it is the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all .",1,9
"this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater , although he is my favorite . when i heard he was going to play a hit-man , i was a little stunned thinking ""can mr . hanks pull this one off"" ? and he did in high fashion . this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty , redemption , and one path that you do not want your children stumbling down . tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan . being the family man , and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman . this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue , which he delivers a knockout performance . on one night of one of his jobs , michael's son michael jr . , played by newcomer tyler hoechlin , witnesses the hit . and michael sr . 's partner in crime , fellow stage actor daniel craig cannot have that information out . so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr . , except michael jr . so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney ( son of paul newman's mr . rooney ) . the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right , even though son is along for the ride . while on this deadly journey , someone has hired a hit for michael sr . the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire , played by a stain-teethed jude law . the movie will have you feeling the old days . and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it , you cannot help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes . so sit back , and enjoy the wild ride .",1,10
plato's run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer ( scarface ) and action star jeff speaksman ( the expert ) . what i liked about plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato's sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10,1,10
"this movie is very underrated . it's highly imaginative , creative and clever . it's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one . but the film was forgotten when it first came out , and became even more overlooked as the years passed . ""bill & ted's bogus journey"" also bombed at the box office , whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular . i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late . in 1991 , bill and ted already seemed ""so '80s"" . even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time , the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap , hip hop , pearl jam , nirvana , grunge and the seattle sound . bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne , van halen and guns n' roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91 , and i think that is one big reason the film bombed at the box office . nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like ""excellent ! "" and ""bogus ! "" in 1991 . ""gremlins 2"" which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s . the transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s . 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 , whereas right now , 2002 and last year 2001 still looks/looked like 1995 or 1996 . if only ""excellent adventure"" which was made in 1988 , was released that year instead of 1989 , and ""bogus journey"" was made quickly and released in 1989 , then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first .",1,10
"one missed call , another asian horror based on the cell phone . i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called ""pon"" . one missed call was just as boring as that one . maybe phones just are not scary or something , but this move was dull and drab . no tension or thrills for me , and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary . the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts , and felt too long . didn't keep my attention . it seems phones are hard to make frightening , it is kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie . and it is ridiculous to compare this with ""the ring"" , it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i have not seen any that measure up in the least . to horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device .",0,3
"one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business . at the time , in 1994 , this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history ( and may continue to hold ) . it was held in pittsburgh , pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film's ""angels"" who ""haunted"" the pittsburgh pirates . in this remake they ""haunt"" the california angels . anyway , the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time ( the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field ) . the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held ( and may even continue to hold ) the record for the largest movie premiere in history , shown to 60 , 000 fans . danny glover , tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans .",1,9
"i just saw this movie on a local tv station ( tv8's ""big chuck and little john"" in cleveland , ohio ) i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it . i know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is . the script is awful . the acting , well other than one of two exceptions , is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort . it looks like a bunch of little ideas , leftover from various writing sessions , that where thrown into a blender . it's not just funny . the ""parody"" aspect is strained at best . some references where almost out of date ( even for the time of it is release ) . no wonder i had never heard of it , it is really bad , worse than anything saturday night live , mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst days . if you see it on tv , it is a great example of how not to make a movie . whatever you do don't waste a cent . adam",0,1
caught this movie on the tube on a sunday . i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it . i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff . i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none . i was shocked at this; i always look at the hated it is as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is . somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie ! i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves .,0,1
"ok , the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale . this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus . first of all , strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus . an organic virus is much more complex , even though it is way tinier . though , it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe , organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna , then change your own rna code . explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor ? maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses ? i could see that , but obviously , the writer did not think of that .",0,1
"well , i'd be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies . still , it was more appealing to me for it is moral value . i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite . my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie , ""hollywood shuffle"" . true , he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable , but his movies are still fun . meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel . i always felt that , if there were superheroes , they would not provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics . meteor man is realistic hero with real problems : car broken into , bad neighborhood , local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution , etc . the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community . what i found to be truly entertaining , outside of james earl jones' ""young forever"" performance , was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers . it was not long before they had a full agenda lined up for him , without his input , of course . it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived . yes , the plot was weak , the movie was predictable , there was bad acting and continuity was rotten , but it ranks #1 with my kids . robert townsend works to bring movies ""home"" so to speak . i doubt he will ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is , but there are and will always be , those that love him for his efforts . one point to ponder about the film , which i find amusing : throughout the entire battle with simon , no one bothered to call the police ? ? ? ? also , what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window ? my mother would have been right there , scrapping by my side , toe-to-toe . dad would be loading his pistol . lol rent it and check it out . it's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad , luther vandross , bill cosby , big daddy kane , etc . great job with the cameos robert !",0,4
"really , when it comes down to it , this movie is just not funny . josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny , and yet he thinks he is hilarious . the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first , until josh's ""look at me , i'm wacky"" approach began infesting each and every scene . the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to , and that is saying quite a bit , since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie . and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies' ""debaser , "" i have just one thing to say : what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this ? what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a terrible movie ?",0,1
"the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they are now able to make really good looking fantasy movies , and that they are all the rage , what with lord of the rings , harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office . this year will see ( and already has seen ) several more , most notably the golden compass , which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year . stardust , based on a novel by neil gaiman , showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep . i saw no previews for it , only a couple of commercials . the critical reaction is kind of blah . i would not even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum , and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend . well , if you will forgive the horrible pun , the stars must have been rightly aligned , because i went to see stardust , and i loved it . it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings . the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . but within that basic outline , the story is lively and imaginative . it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . and it succeeds wonderfully . there were a lot of big films this summer , but none of them were nearly as fun as this one . there's a lot going on , but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent . it is not a masterpiece , but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has ( though i do not like it quite as much as the earlier film ) . a lot of fun to be had here if you are a fan of the genre .",1,9
"as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school , i thought i would add my comments . seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film . the characters have so many complexities , everyone can relate to them in their own way . the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters , rather than being spoon-fed an opinion . you can love them or dislike them , and still feel the emotional impact of the movie . wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life . i'd highly recommend it .",1,9
"doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent . so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles . along with kairee , its an example of marathi cinema at its best . there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in . these scenes probably emerge from the film-maker's political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it . but apart from such minor quibbles , its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend . sumitra bhave's concern and humanism shines through .",1,8
"a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . . there was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""star wars"" film was released . he does not remember first seeing the movie , but he also does not remember life before it . he does remember the first ""star wars"" themed gift he got . . . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set . he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be . but years later , he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he is ever received : another box full of action figures , ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection . it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed , anakin skywalker , stopped being produced and carried in stores , and how this boy went for about ten years ( until he got into college ) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets ( do not ask . . . it is a northern illinois university thing ) . i cannot review ""star wars"" as a movie . it represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood . there's no separating it in my mind from christmases , birthdays , summers and winters growing up . in the winter , my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth ( i was always han solo ) . my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house , and that served as the ewok village . they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it , and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home . i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""star wars"" and i think people either just understand that or they do not . i do not get the appeal of ""lord of the rings"" or ""star trek"" but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films . i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time . every time i put them in the dvd player , i feel like i'm eight years old again , when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker . grade ( for the entire trilogy ) : a+",1,10
"i just have to throw my two cents in . relax , it is a comedy . yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted . i cannot think of many comedies where they are not . this is not a new release , it is out on video and airs on cable almost every week . would i see it in a theater ? sure , i did , when it first came out . it's funny . . . that should be enough . even if i did not like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton . he's an underrated and under-appreciated actor . i cannot think of another who is so capable in every genre . nor can i think of one who is as successful . a comedic actor who is also an action star ( short lived but still ) , who is also a romantic lead , who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero . i cannot think of any , at least not in hollywood . certainly none who have been successful at all those genres . i mean there is tom cruise but to me he is better at being tom cruise than becoming a character . however this is not about michael keaton vs . tom cruise so i'll move on . gung ho is worth renting , heck it is worth buying since you can probably find it for $10 . 00 or less at stores like wal-mart . it's worth watching on cable ( if you have cable or satellite ) . it's one of those fun to watch movies . you can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away . to ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .",1,8
"""atlantis : the lost empire"" was everything the previews indicated it would be . it is not often you find that . most of the time , the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible . not so with this one . i was pleased with the original plot , even though the sub-plots were not . the animation was not break through like ""shrek"" but it was good , none the less . the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them . this keeps you interested . i found myself enjoying this one . ""atlantis"" gets and keeps your attention . you also have to think a little bit , but not too much . once you think about it a little , you can figure out what needs to happen but you really do not know for sure how it is going to happen . the casting was also good . michael j . fox , as milo was an excellent choice . his personality fits nicely . the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner . his character reminded me of his performance in ""maverick"" which i also liked . i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair . her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting . it's just too bad she is a villain . over all , definitely worth you while ( 8 out of 10 ) .",1,8

"generally i like horror movies , but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand . we sat down to watch it , ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much . the concept is not that bad , but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i do not know . the worst thing about the movie is the actors . the camera work was poor , the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous , but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm . they were wooden beyond measure , especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent . he looked more like a public school boy in fact . there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical , but then i remembered it was not supposed to be a comedy . i'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts , but there simply is not . let's hope ten was the lucky number and they do not do another one , i'm not sure my ribs could take it .",0,1
"most reviews say that this is the weakest point in hamilton's short movie career . this movie is a bit different from the rest , and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie , and what you expect from hamilton . knowing hamilton as a photographer , you can be slightly surprised . while bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian , with a plot connecting these scenes , laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them ( male-female , artist-model ) but though we see beautiful photos , many of them better than his average , their number is reduced for the sake of the plot . tendres cousines is different from both , it is only hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos . because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than hamilton's fans , looking like an erotic comedy ( but not german soft-core type - ""schulm dchen report"" fans would be very disappointed ) . you will not laugh a lot , but you can smile ( and that is something you do not often get from hamilton ) . unlike all other hamilton's movies the age of female varies . unlike other movies main character is a boy . unlike his usual works this one is not put out of place and out of time . we have characters that live their life , have their destiny and do not lead us only from one photo to another , from one nude girl to another . unfortunately , hamilton ( again ) gets lost with a script in his hands . girls on beaches , under shower , in low-light rooms , in gardens , under tents , in front of mirrors , regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory , he can shoot minutes and hours , and whatever he does you will always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it . but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script . hamilton is best known for his nudes , but they are just a part of his work . and in tendres cousines we have a reverse situation : his girls are not in the best shots . nature , garden , house remind us on hamilton's work ( often neglected part of it ) , while girls , even when nude , do not have anything special in the way he presents us . maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera , maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept , maybe he was really trying to make something new ( and no one dared to tell him he should not ) , but he neglected what he was mostly praised for .",1,8
"japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film , chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence . as they are running , we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment . the act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck people's lives . in some way , what they are really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing , but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams . running makes them all feel truly alive . the big life-altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big , violent , and so absurd that it is funny in a clever way . one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu .",1,10

"the 1st season was amazing , the whole idea of them adjusting to the island , while mysteries were being explored ( and seen ) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense , tons of cliffhangers , and an amazing plot . i mean , i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island . and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention . from then on , i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season , only a little better . i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative . the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious , creepy , and exciting . i loved all the suspense surround others on the island , but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing . season 3 was not quite as good as 1 and 2 . . . but nonetheless , great . i loved seeing the back-stories of the others , seeing their camp , and seeing the mysteries further explored . ( ""tricia tanak is dead"" is one of my favorite episodes ) . this season , while not as good , was still breathtaking and fun , but most of all exciting ! now , the 4th season . i had hopes for this season , and the 1st couple of episodes we are good , but then it really started to get boring and monotonous . i mean , i really despise the new ""rescuers"" such as miles and daniel . the plot got old after the first couple episodes . . . and most of all . . . . season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series : the mystery , suspense , comedy mixed in ( charlie gone ) and overall excitement . also , some of my favorite characters have left .",1,10
"this series got me into deighton's writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story . i would however disagree with the above comment . from what i have read in the past , it is not holm's performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson's field career . the scene is not in the book , the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany , not the polish frontier . this whole storyline is cloth . the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story . my perspective on holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife's defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . as clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence .",1,10
"seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately . this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic . i happened to see the dubbed version but i'm on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue . still , the dubbing did not get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour : ""poison clan rocks the world ! ! ! "" the story-telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue , suspense , and inter-personal relationships . you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace . the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed . it's like watching real animals fight each other , but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms . such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema . the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution . . . . of course , if you just want to see people pummel each other , along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture , be my guest !",1,10
"ah winter kills , based on the novel by richard condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the united states 20 years ago . i knew condon also wrote the manchurian candidate which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller winter kills left me cold . it's not a thriller - it's a piece of worthless crap , possibly the worst movie i've seen this month and boy have i seen a lot of bad movies in june . the problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as william richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce there's two things wrong with this movie . first off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner . it's not as ott as say something like that james bond movie with david niven and peter sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances . this might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there is none . as a satire it is very silly , so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable . secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they are rendered senseless . take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called dawson . dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane . the scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason a dire movie that is an ordeal to sit through",0,2
"""angels in the outfield"" was originally a 1951 movie from the ted turner library; disney remade it in 1994 , this time , using the california angels ( now the los angeles angels ) as the team ( disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team; also , good use of the words , huh ? ? ? ? ? ) . this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family . a man promised the boys a family , only if the angels won the pennant . so , he called upon god one night about this . the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way ( and only that boy ) ; for instance , when the first angel had come down , a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break , so did the ball ! ! ! ! ! for much of the post-all star season of 1994 , the angels were at the top of the al west ( of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is ) . however , they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox/angels game ( there was no central division in baseball back then , hence chicago being in the west ) , and no angels were there to help . thus , a new rule was created : no angels can help in championship games . but wait ! in the final championship game , the angels won ! ! ! ! ! it was a miracle indeed ! what i liked about this film : this is a good movie . i mean , i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff; look at me now ! my work was good ! ! ! ! ! so for one , this shows that if you believe , god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life . and second , this is a family baseball movie , which is always exciting . this is an old disney movie , too; i've seen this just recently on the new disney channel ( blech ! ! ! ! ! ) .

"this movie is like the material s . e . hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s , and , had trueblood actually been a product of either , the results might have been much better ( especially in the acting department ) . instead , we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity . jeff fahey plays ray trueblood , a former street rumbler , i suppose is the accurate description . this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music . nonetheless , ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother , donny ( chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot ) , who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when , on the run from the cops , he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines . flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs , although in a gang that was ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled ( and again , cops must be dodged and this time , a lady's honor defended in the action film sense ) before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother , donny . for the most part , the film is quite ridiculous . for me , most of this has to do with far too much overacting , although not by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends . the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs . although , the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989 .",0,4
"i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role . leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations , but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film . actor miguel n ez who played little richard in ""why do fools fall in love ? "" was a much more suitable choice , having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona . if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well . and this is what has happened here . glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism . what ""the temptations"" did so well in capturing the rise of the group , warts and all , this film misses by a wide mark . what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with ""the hollywood shuffle"" ? he's a talented , funny guy but has not delivered anything near that first effort .",0,2
"i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep . this , in itself , was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie . i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film . how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done . it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were . case in point - near the end of the ""duel"" , the banjo-playing boy was smiling ( loved his banjo ) , but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the ""duel"" , the kid was too reserved to respond . the river trip never left you bored , for sure . the rape scene was brutal , but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia . i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done . some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal . i disagree - if you really payed attention , he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following , in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy . it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later , at the top of the cliff . it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die , but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect . anyway , a great movie , and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote , but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a ""1"" , i gave it a ""10"" . this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias , rather than an objective viewpoint , and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating .",1,10

"on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami , lisa reisert ( rachel mcadams ) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die . red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats . the premise is similar to cellular and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films . almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense , the acting and the direction . most of the film does take place on a plane but that does not slow down the movie . the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots . wes craven does a really good job behind the camera . instead of focusing on the thrills , he focuses on the story and the characters . the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that is not what the film is really about . i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on . red eye really shows his skills at storytelling . red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast . rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate . you may even end up cheering for her out loud . cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain . the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive . the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and jayma mays . the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it . the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape . overall , the tone of the film is consistently creepy . the screenplay is not as strong as everything else though . there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer . most of them did not bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head . also , the ending is disappointing . it is not a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better . since the movie focuses on the characters , there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps . if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed . in the end , red eye is an engaging thriller and it is one of the best movies of the summer . rating 8/10",1,8
"i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year . attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal . visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes . sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come . seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy-but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him . however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever ! don't argue for out for a kill , ticker , or even black dawn folks . this is the bottom of the septic tank here . anyone who says this is steven seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste . seagal is yet another agent/i'm a supreme bad-ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public . not to mention the dealers are not from around here . the whole production from directing to the acting is poor . was this movie shot in the dark ? its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2 . the action is terrible and very badly done . the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most : throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal . who seems to show little enthusiasm here . can ya blame him ? while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for ( originally harvester ) and surely has to be better than attack force . the post-production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse . i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots . so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess . but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie ?",0,1

"ira levin's deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film . therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one german psychic along for the ride . director sidney lumet , no stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on . the dialog is quick , fresh , and witty . michael caine excels in roles like these . christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . irene worth stands out as the funny psychic . how about dyan cannon ? love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now ? deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat , and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending , but watching caine and reeve under lumet's direction with levin's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film .",1,7

"i've read a lot of comments about the film and how it is so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool , and even though it technically is , i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film . just because it is the sequel does not mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first , and i enjoyed that so much about it . the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first , which makes sense because the movie is not called henry fool 2 , it is fay grim . all that aside , the film , i thought , was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me . i was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line ( aka parker's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio ) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost does not seem so , which i absolutely loved . there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films , but never do . the cinematography was brilliant due to it is simplicity and truly making the film seem 'grim' throughout - in terms of setting . the writing was so well put together as well , whoever said this movie is not as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen; i almost cannot even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was , and pertinent . and well , parker posey , who could complain ? the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional . and i thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on ( in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost ) . the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film , and i believe the point of the film , was parker's love and naivety about fool , which was so endearing and turned , yes very quickly , from denial to outright passion . the last five minutes of the film were perfect . obviously there were things that were not excellent , but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor , and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand , but in the end you got it and did not even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension . ( this may also have to do with goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast ) on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i've seen this year; stylistically pleasing , clever and witty writing , performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors , and a truly touching film , and do not forget , a complete departure from fool . which was the point .",1,9
"i wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute ""borat"" tonight , and left quite disappointed . i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit , and routinely go to see animated films . that being said , i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out , but stayed waiting for this film to get better . never happened . the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch , especially in my opinion , that of kate winslet and ian mckellen ( i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto ) . the problem with this movie for me is it is one of those animated features for the add-set . it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another , weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an ""important message . "" it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category , and considering the way it is scoring with critics , i would not be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware . but if you are looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats , take my advice and wait for ratatouille .",0,3
"seriously , i've read some of the reviews on this film , and i have to ask , were you people watching the same movie . yes , i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage los angeles , but so what ? none of the characters are likable , the story seems aimless , karen black is simply not a very good actress . donald sutherland is just icky . ( and his character ""homer simpson"" makes me wish for the animated version . d'oh ! ) then you had the creepy child actor , the creepier billy barty , and so on . this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go , ""what the heck !

"this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen . he has done it with `batman' , `sleepy hollow' and now this . this is not a remake . the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak ( and charleton heston makes a cameo ) . burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today's mass viewership . the original planet of the apes was a product of its time . during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization . it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . in that context , pota was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . the dialectic between colonel taylor ( charleton heston ) , dr . cornelius ( roddy mcdowall ) and dr . zira ( kim hunter ) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious . burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties . this is apes for dummies . it is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . the `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , burton's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , `i know something you do not know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out . ' from a technical perspective , as is always the case with burton's film , the film is excellent . the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding ( though i continue to dislike his dark look ) . however , thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script . the story has been reduced to a monster movie . the humans band together behind captain davidson ( mark wahlberg ) to fight the monstrous apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats ( notably helena bonham carter as ari ) . the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today's fast food mentality . the acting is mixed . mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . this part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire . helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager . then there is tim roth . his is a virtuoso performance , single-handedly saving the film from total ruin . roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade . he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time . additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists . this film is a great disappointment . it is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . i rated it a 3/10 . from a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 9/10 . however the story is an insult to the original franchise . it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . of course it is true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .",0,3
"i have not read the other comments on the film , but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary . i watched it for the second time with my children . they absolutely loved it . true , it did not have the adults rolling around the floor , but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so . it is a true mel brooks farce , with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money , not for whom we are , and how fickle are our friends and associates . there are many other films on a similar subject matter , no doubt , many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults . it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family , however . hence , for the children , a 9/10 from me .",1,9
"since my third or fourth viewing some time ago , i've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd . in the meantime , i've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon's monograph on jean eustache . the latter ends with a frustrating filmography , eleven films , fiction , doc , and in-between , impossible to see or , in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le p re no l . . . , re-see . a few questions that hit me this moment : polish v ronika's french is plenty colloquial ( un maximum d' ""un maximum d'"" ) . even so , does she have an accent ? i think i can tell she does . what does the absence of color add , especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed ? how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter's tale ? ditto alphaville . we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it , but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu ? is this an enchanted isle ? is alexandre's a fairy tale ? alexandre's always choreographing himself , worrying about how or where to stand or walk , what to say when , announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does . or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself ? how different is he from vertigo's scottie ? ( i say , i think , very . ) what's the difference , and is there one , between eustache is l aud , and truffaut's , and godard's ? how different is the present l aud ? isn't he still doing it , whatever it is , in recent roles , irma vep , le pornographe , whatever , approaching old age ? once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel ( l aud's character ) truffaut films . for a long while , every three or five minutes , down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf , tweedy coat , l aud hair , with a direction-seeking nose . i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry . i was that age , but have no idea what i myself looked like then . no scarf , at least . i do have a brother , though , who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson .",1,10
"this is not a movie . it is a collection of unrelated , ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-dv camera . in fact , i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair , dead-pan stare , ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase . if you made it further than the ten minutes i did , do not bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above . this is a true and complete waste of time , money and film that would have made william one-shot beaudine cringe . the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity . what's next ? six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal-mart snack counter ?",0,1

"this is definitely one of jet's best efforts . few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can . the action is rapid-fire , and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes . as a result , it may take americans a little off-guard . a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film . i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces ( especially fist of legend ) making it into the us market . a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts .",1,8

"after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes . though i guess not . if the first one was not bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch . with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever . though they could not , they had to take all the same raunchy , not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again . though the thing is i did not laugh at it the first time . they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level . most of the time it is just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it is hard to watch it and enjoy it . then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene . also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into the age range that it is supposed to be funny for . while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do find this funny then you probably are not one of the more mature or intelligent people around . it does not take that much skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs . it's a movie parody that is actually good and well done and it did not have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either .",0,1
"this movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from april 10 , 2002 through april 14 , 2002 in the venezuelan presidential palace , caracas venezuela . the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain , sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez . one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure . hugo chavez's persona single-handedly brought the venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old military-installed junta and re-establish the democratically installed government of venezuela . it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat . that the mainstream media aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising . what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media . it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986 to turn america into blind and rudderless state . may hugo chavez open patriotic americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision .",1,10

"over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check ! weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - check ! mobile suits based on angels - check ! ok - its a gundam series . this one , gundam wing , has good character development , real-world complexity , interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy . with characters , the initially weak relena dorlan ( later peacecraft , then back to dorlan ) gets stronger and more independent ( although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy , the series main character ) . the aforementioned heero , initially a cold , hard butcherer , becomes more and more human , while still remaining in-character . and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft ( whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise ) float between oz , freelance , and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations . the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works . however , in 49 half-hour episodes , it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity is not used to its full potential . the ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting , the desire for peace , etc - are ones that resonate even today . in retrospect , the series was ahead of its time , what with the ""war on terrorism"" and all . but its exploration of these ideas , the monologues , especially those of treize kushrenada , is an incredible dramatic piece , forming some of the best writing in the series . but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor , which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge . in terms of eye-candy , which is what this one has in bucketloads , everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra ( no not the tampons you idiot ! ) is wells designed , and explodes in big balls of orange ( which is bad , because better animation would have had better explosions ) . but who cares ? ! stuff explodes , and thats all that matters . in short though , the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes , you have missed out on a lot . the poor writing can leave you cringing , and sometimes the animation makes you go ""wtf ? ! ? !

"in the previews , ""the 40 year-old virgin"" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he has not . too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely . and then the unexpected happens : he falls in love . what's more , there is a movie out about it , and it is called ""the 40 year-old virgin . "" the virgin of the title is andy stitzer ( steve carell ) , who is indeed 40 , works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures , which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see . he has a lovely home theater system and watches ""survivor"" with his two kind elderly neighbors . he's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women . now here's the real novelty with this picture : it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute , mature fashion . this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers . it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low . sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community ( which are , in no way , meant to be taken as gay-bashing ) , as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game ( ""mortal kombat : deception , "" no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys ) . as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 , collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed , i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been . i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40 . a bit arrogant , i know , but would you ( ""you"" is italicized ) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of ""the 40 year-old virgin"" ? of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with ""morning rise"" ( do not ask ) , and he is pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex . when it is first discovered andy is a virgin , at 40 , his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david ( paul rudd ) , jay ( romany malco ) and cal ( seth rogen ) all at first assume he is gay because he is never been with a woman , which could not be any further from the truth . the truth is , andy loves women , but past traumatic experiences ( revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence ) have put him on the sidelines for good . david , jay , and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid , so help them all . but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster , as proved by one date with nicky ( leslie mann ) , who puts andy through the worst drunk-driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth ( elizabeth banks ) , the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend . things brighten up for andy when he meets trish ( catherine keener ) , the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people . hmmm . and with that nice-looking collection of action figures , you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him , that is if he can ever ""do the deed . "" at last , this is the sex romp we have been waiting for . it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through , not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let us look at the big picture : how many of us ""lonely guys"" want to be a lonely guy forever ? the important thing we are taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself . i do not think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does ( which is side-splitting to be honest , and according to this website and various other news articles , was in fact real , and so was the blood on carell's shirt afterward ) . ""the 40 year-old virgin"" was directed by judd apatow and co-written by himself and carell , which originated as a skit that starred carell . carell is sweet and human , as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut . this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i've ever seen and is not offensive ( a whole lot ) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect . even carell's buddies , who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities , can be related to on a fundamental level . the way ""the 40 year-old virgin"" plays out is indeed funny in the end , but i'll leave that up to you , the viewer , to observe . surely , if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener , then it is true : it is never too late ! 10/10",1,10
"this film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill ""wonder of the human body"" documentaries by bravely , if bizarrely , opting to elicit disgust in the viewer . in one scene , the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it . in another , the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo . in a final tour de force , the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of . . . teenage armpit hair . unfortunately , i'm not making any of this up . see this film if you must , but : bring your vomit bag , and do not have pasta salad beforehand .",0,2

"the plot intellect is about as light as feather down . but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in ""the gay divorcee"" and ""top hat"" is now absent . instead of the typical accidental acquaintance , the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin , who are still in love since their dancing days . of course , being a 30s musical , there is the problems of misunderstood romance , classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special . and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances , there is nothing better for hollywood's best entertainers than put on a show . delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show . top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end , which remains a refreshing change . fred and ginger are out again to charm the world . . . and charm the navy . everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable . pure classic silliness at its best . but with astaire and rogers , we just know it is got to work . rating : 8 . 25/10",1,8
"i love kristen dunst , especially in elizabethtown . i guess she is the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . she did that , and she looked so natural in elizabethtown . in this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . while in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and i just could not tell her to be an editor any way . therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . the film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring . the character of young is full and reasonable . anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . the only big defect is that it did not show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story . i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons .",1,7
"he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case , portraying attorney ( and murderer ) tom capano . kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim , anne marie fahey , but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim . we are sorry for the situation , but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women ( including rachel ward ) as well . the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues , and capano actually had her psychologist killed . pretty hard to believe , but this was based on a true story . there is a cameo with olympia dukakis ( excellent ) as capano's mother . all in all , an interesting story because it is based on a true murder , and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate details . 8/10 .",1,8
"this could not have been better . the strong restraints on mike sullivan's expressions could not have been portrayed in any other way . tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career . young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; playing the basis character for the story . and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time . this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner . this is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . mike sullivan had no father as a child , so john rooney took him in . although a generous man , mr . rooney involved himself in organized crime . therefore , the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . now , sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . the events to follow , will test sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate . with a great adaptation by david self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting ( brilliant art direction by richard l . johnson & nancy haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . driving the story , is thomas newman's wonderful irish score , settling in only when necessary . but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l . hall's beautiful photography . this is some of the best cinematography i've seen; and i watch a lot of films . the scene when mike and michael are in the car , entering chicago is quite impressive . the shot starts at the front of the car , revealing mike ( hanks ) through the windshield . it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see michael ( hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . as it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's chicago . with a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . i'm talking about sam mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty . ( won him various awards ) before american beauty , mendes worked as a play director for the british theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . with only two films , sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( in a list of about twenty-five ) . the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . the photography , acting and story is phenominal . i'm still waiting for scorcesee's gangs of new york , but for now , i'm fully confident in saying that this is the ""best film of the year"" . considering it is competition ( signs , insomnia , minority report ) thats a strong statement .",1,9
"silly , simplistic , and short , gun crazy ( volume 1 : a woman from nowhere ) goes nowhere . this brief ( just over sixty minutes ) tale is not so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of sam raimi's the quick & the dead ( his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns ) brought into a contemporary setting . in quick & dead , sharon stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff ( played by gene hackman ) who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father ( a brief cameo by gary sinise ) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head . in gun crazy , saki ( played by the nimble ryoko yonekura ) seeks revenge against the dastardly mr . tojo ( played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi ) , who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch , and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck . the only significant difference , despite the settings , is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with well , i will not spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it . in short , saki a pale imitation of the clint eastwood's 'man with no name' rides into the town basically , there is a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base , so i guess that suffices for a town corrupted by tojo , the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored . confessing her true self as a bounty hunter , saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo . of course , by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys , but she rises to the occasion on her knees , in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher . don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher . just watch it for yourself . try not to laugh . the image quality is average for the dvd release . there is a grainy quality to several sequences , but , all in all , this is not a bad transfer . the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times , but , again , it is not a bad transfer . rather , it is a bad film .",0,1
"what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized ! this is the first filmed version of 'hamlet' to use the full text of shakespeare's play , but branagh did not do it just because ""it was there . "" his intention , i believe , was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down , so to speak . in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves , a fair enough proposition and one that is a bargain . the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well , it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself . the production design and cinematography and both outstanding , which helps immensely when you are watching a four-hour movie . branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise . the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play . since so much of 'hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels , battles , etc . , this can be a daunting task . but everything branagh tries to do seems to work . branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors , if not always the best , since he made his big splash with 'henry v . ' one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times . in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again , but there is a method at work . let's face it , 'hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before , he or she needs help even if they have read the play . hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film , even if you do not know the literal meaning of every arcane word . this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination . there are so many other outstanding performances here they are almost too numerous to mention , but some of them must be acknowledged . derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise . her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling , made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time ! she looks to me like the finest young actress around . other super performers in no particular order are richard briers , nicholas farrell , michael maloney , and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz , respectively . honorable mention goes to julie christie , charlton heston , and robin williams , who manages to do his thing here successfully . even billy crystal as a gravedigger works . the one cast member who does not , inexplicably , is jack lemmon . in the very opening scene he appears , and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood , lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor . you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh , since everything else about the movies screams out that it is the work of a perfectionist . not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie , but it does seem just a tad too long . some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit , if i may be so bold , and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome . did i forget anything , other than patrick doyle's score ? no doubt i did . i'll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'hamlet , ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one .",1,10
"suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s tv hit ""love , american style , "" decked out with flashes of nudity , ""superchick"" ( 1973 ) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain . and the lead character here , tara b . true , really is some kind of superchick . a stewardess ( not flight attendant ) who is so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her ( ! ) , and with a hunky boyfriend in every port , this wingin' , swingin' gal really does put the ""lay"" in ""layover . "" what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york , her playboy with gangster problems in miami , and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l . a . , tara sure does keep busy . and when she is not draining these guys of all their manly energies , as the viewer learns , she is liable to be taking a karate class , mile-high clubbing , fending off flashers and rapists , attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane . as i said , lighthearted fun , and surely good for a night when you are feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube . future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara , and the film looks handsome enough to please . disappointingly , buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin ( aka candy samples ) are wasted here in very small roles , but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles ! though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and does not really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head , it does succeed in being consistently amusing , and i suppose that is something . strange that the end credits should call attention to ms . jillson's body double , however; do not think i've ever seen that before !",0,4
"i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role . compared to sharon stone , madonna is too coarse and bauerisch . she is not even close . evil incarnate : sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth , the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding . however , she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption . in the obligatory sex scene , she projects pure , crystalline lust . especially her hooded , luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure . thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques , the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest . rather , she seems to have a slight golden glow ( yes , yeats ) . the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes . the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed . i would not have had a chance . the original basic instinct; attempts at censorship : i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film , set in san francisco , a beautiful city worthy of this film . it is outstanding , from the music to the locations to the sets , and so on . paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew . that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups . attempts at censorship were vehemently denied . swell . these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script , insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas . example : sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny , they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy . on locations in san francisco , the gentle , tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise , flashing lights and other tactics . the executive producers , mario kassar and andrew vajna , vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics . blowback : thanks to the fulminating activists , the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising . their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched . it also received widespread critical acclaim . it was , in the words of the reptilian hackett in network , ""a big- titted hit !

"a serious comedy . ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play ""les joies de la famille"" ( later americanized as ""a very rich woman"" ) is plush , well cast , occasionally funny . . . and unfortunately timeless . a wealthy california widow , who appears to be frittering away her money , is railroaded by her two grown , greedy daughters , both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance . the whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will , and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing , is touchy material for a comedy ( and to his credit , director david lowell rich does not overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment ) . some of the humor is a little broad and does not work , yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note . sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter , and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer . the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly , and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time , that the seriousness of ""rosie !

"lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances , and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work , something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages , in a way that just makes you feel good . a bug's life has that same charm , it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects , because even though they talk , they still act just like real bugs . it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them , to imagine bugs the way a young mind does . honey , i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger , and to me , a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie , if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities . i try not to compare it to something like toy story ( which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made ) , because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's , but then again , almost nothing is . the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun . the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society , mostly geared around building a harvest of food , most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers , vastly superior in strength and general meanness , and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter . we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers , who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food , the consequences will be dire . and incidentally , the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the ""great leap forward "" the fun and excitement begins when flik , the main character , sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers . you see , he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger , so he feels it is his responsibility , but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers . great for the audience , not so great for the safety of the clan . the movie was released back in the late 90s , when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos , like armageddon and deep impact , independence day and the arrival , a bug's life and antz , etc . comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable , although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film , and not only because it does not star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role . this is great family fun !",1,9

"singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with . i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart; however , this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous . in addition , there are a bunch of ""might-makes-right"" messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up . i mean , who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks ? however , he way singleton portrays the ""fight"" is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else . there is another ""bad guy"" ( in reality a drunken frat boy ) who rapes one of the movie's protagonists . in this instance , i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one . in any event , he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas . i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape . well , no means no , this is a rape , which probably occurs a lot in universities across the country . having established the rape , how does singleton deal with it ? when the frat boy tries to call the woman , her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone , at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a ""black bitch . "" the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube , et al , who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged ""apologies"" to roommate for his racist remarks; however the ( apparently in singleton's mind ) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned . again , no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however , singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks . what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton , while no doubt a talented director , does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude .",0,1

"imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid-friendly . or if a television producer told chris rock he could not cuss so that his specials could be rated pg . in the same way , the director of the movie ""something wicked this way comes"" took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . in trying to make the story of ""something wicked this way comes"" easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . this is apparent in will's character transformation , charles halloway's rescue of jim , and the carnival's defeat . will's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . the scene in which the dust witch visits will's house in a balloon has been cut from the film . instead , a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders . the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . he gets on top of a neighbor's roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the witch . ""sorry , dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . this time it is me out , alone , "" will decides as he prepares to face her ( 147 . ) removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome . the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim , but never growing curious like his friend . in the book , will has both a good , quiet side and an ""evil , "" daring side like his jim . in the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys bradbury's theme of both good and evil being present in each person . in the book , will saves jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , charles halloway saves jim to repay jim's father . will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury's novel because he does not want his best friend to grow up without him . it is the good in will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival . on the carousel , jim ""gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship"" ( 269 . ) this shows that there was good left inside of jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes jim's father , who saved will when he was a little boy . by changing the motivation for saving jim , the filmmakers have ruined bradbury's original idea that it takes good to win against evil . in the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . when the book ends , mr . dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he cannot stand it and evaporates . in bradbury's world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . his message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . ""good to evil seems evil , "" says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr . dark . ""so i will do only good to you , jed . i'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself"" ( 275 . ) in the movie , mr . dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . this takes away the major theme of bradbury's book , which is that doing ""good"" toward others wards off evil . good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid-friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . in the movie , ""something wicked this way comes , "" will does not transform , will's friendship does not save jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . as a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury's main points . the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . in the case of this story , bradbury's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself .",0,3
"claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie : too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing ( that the screen is cut off ) , because there seems to be important actions going on , but you cannot see them . there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie , so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals . i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work . i can handle deep and slow movies . but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully . nothing to get attached to , to any of the characters , because they are not worked out well enough . to work out characters more is needed , than just minute long face shots , at least with this set of script+director+actors . i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors . i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future . what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history , and for someone who spent time in shanghai .",0,1

"earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement : ""the character development in newer movies just is not nearly as good or interesting as it used to be . "" depending on the film ( s ) in question , this can be attributed to a number of things , sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds , but in the case of over-the-top , uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put ""art"" back into cinema , it is movies like dog days that are to blame . i normally have a very high tolerance for movies , no matter how dull or pointless i find them ( ranging from good , long ones like andrei rublev and dogville , to ones i've considered painful to sit through a la alpha dog and wild wild west ) . i shut this movie off 45 minutes in , which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have . i was not interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism . in an attempt to say something about the dregs of society , this film too easily falls into being self-indulgent , trite , and exploitative in a very sincere sense . granted , i've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject , but there are so many better films out there about depressing , pathetic people ( happiness , gummo , kids , salo , storytelling , irreversible ) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality . dog days had none more than an eighth grader's distaste for society , choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are , and instead choosing to be a dull , awful , and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of ""art . "" this is not a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society , it is just boring and nothing worth caring about .",0,2
"hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences are not really interested in what puts protagonists into danger - only that they are in danger , and need to escape . this film proves hitchcock was not 100% correct . police believe jean simmons is guilty of a crime , when she plainly is not . trevor howard decides their best course of action is to run for it . and so , the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains , buses and coaches - jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall - scrambling across dockyard roofs . all good exciting stuff - but i could not get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary . they should have stayed put . in other words , the macguffin was not strong enough .",1,7
"in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken , reluctantly , by melania . she attracts the attentions of an american , seymour , who becomes obsessed with her , paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright . she has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own . however , we are in ""modern art-house cinema"" territory , so conventions like narrative structure , lighting the subject so it can be seen , camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned . much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care . people began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and i do not think i've ever seen so many people walk out . images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen , we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra-red . in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness . but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional . on the whole , almost entirely without merit .",0,1

"we open with colonel luc deveraux ( van damme ) , the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers . they almost kill the two , then oh wait , it was just a field test . deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers . why he would want to be involved in this ( if you know anything about the original ) is never explained and well beyond me . it's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going . the united states government has cut the universal soldier's project budget and in the process angered seth ( the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers ) . naturally he will not be shut down without a fight . so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out . which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel , but that does not stop it from becoming stupid as hell . for instance , one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg . seems you cannot go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie . he's big , he is tough , right ? wrong . van damme does not seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him . . . once . . . twice . . . three times . the point here lost on me . then there is the breaking of glass . a rudimentary part of any action movie , but someone involved must have a glass fetish . you have to see the fight scenes in particular . let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips . then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck , they have seth ( the computer ) secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black ( michael jai white ) . nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem . potentially offensive and just downright lame . he's no replacement for dolph , either . universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel . it's loud , it is dumb and it does not care . the original was not anything poetic , but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level . the sequel does not . they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence . so give credit where credit is due .",0,3
"this movie was banned in england ? why ? tom savini , george romero , dario argento , lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since . . . this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film . good looking girls ( who cannot act to save their lives , by the way ) , a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour , a scythe , a crazy brother wandering around the family estate , and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end . but banned ? seriously . when the english parliament banned this movie , the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were . there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore ( which was greatly underdone ) . there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made , obviously . but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned . i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with . as it stands , the film is entertaining , but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result . banned . . . what a joke . . .",0,4
"the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course ! it's a textbook example of how not to make a movie . watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them . call me old-fashioned , but i think of movies as a means of communication , and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director is talking about . the director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of ""hollywood conventions"" . among those conventions , alas , is consistency of character and clarity of concept . the director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand points where he has purposely avoided a ""hollywood clich "" . however , he never seems to grasp the idea that clich s exist for a reason . they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly . it's fine to avoid them , but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea , not simply eliminated . the film is built on an intriguing premise , rich with potential . two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii . soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them . someone with less disdain for the ""hollywood convention"" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea . this film certainly is not it ! the puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters , but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script . in particular , i'm becoming increasingly impressed by gonzo , who plays the lively corpse . in a number of muppet films , he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet .",0,2

"new york , i love you finally makes it to our shores , but its 10 short stories on love somehow did not find reason enough to be released over valentine's , probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar new year , and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan ( no , not the spy next door ) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success . so why fix a formula that has not been broken ? continuing in concept where paris , je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise ( shanghai will be next , so says the end of the closing credits here ) , the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme , although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules , and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else ( well , it was shot in black and white ) , but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least . structurally , this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor , which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created . here a little more leeway is given , where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together , and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes , in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers , though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise , though already seen in paris . one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one , is definitely the creative forces behind the stories , from writers , directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city , coming together for a concept film . and what more the star-studded cast too , with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances , be it for the entire length of the short , or as a support to build upon . you cannot deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables , from irrfan khan to natalie portman ( who also had writing and directing duties ) , rachel bilson ( looking quite like bardot ) to spielberg's blue eye boy shia labeouf , who surprisingly can act , and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date . story wise , like any anthology , you will find some which will automatically appeal to you , and with others that do not . some are straightforward in nature , while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked . but these 10 stories plus 1 ( because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks ) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor , with stories more rooted in reality , compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film ( elijah wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone ? ) , or even less adventurous with its narrative style ( christopher doyle's , and tom tykwer's starring natalie portman ) . here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe , with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment . minor quibbles aside , i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here , contrary to what many others have felt about it . the short film format is still very much alive , and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine , and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup . i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here . we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore , i love you , so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road . otherwise there is always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules .",1,8
"the matador is a strange film . its main character julian , played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan , is not your typical hero . julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises . having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely . and so , after a chance meeting at a bar with danny ( greg kinnear ) , he latches on and begins a halting , awkward friendship . danny , the quintessential nice guy , is dealing with some stuff in his own life and , truth be told , could use a friend as well . the two make an unexpected connection , and danny sticks around to hear julian's story , even after learning the ""unsavory"" truth about julian's work . matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema , the anti-hero assassin ( films like 'assassins' and 'grosse pointe blank' come to mind ) . but matador differs in several key ways . first of all , the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail , meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you . and second , unlike most anti-hero films , matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character . julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing . this is unusual , given that 99 . 99% of us would consider killing for money horrific . and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic . although we do not like to admit it , almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough , maybe even murder . did julian's victims deserve to die ? who is paying to have people killed ? who knows . the movie never deals with these questions . the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship . if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer , but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity . sympathy for the devil , i guess . brosnan's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling . he does not completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm , but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix . weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance . it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him . it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays , but it works . the films only other major role , that of danny , is not nearly as meaty . kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems . the film does not really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists , but i was not able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying . it does not have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human . and it did not have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored . maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another , and how those needs have no moral prerequisites . even a murderer needs friends , and even good people can be friends with bad people . it's a comment on the strange , random world we live in . a good film; worth seeing .",1,7

"""gone with the wind"" is one of the most overrated movies in history . it is a film loved by mothers , grandmothers , and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years . as a zombie movie , it blows . there is not a shambling corpse in sight , and it is terribly light in the gore department . ""zombie 3"" , on the other hand , is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore , it is better than ""gone with the wind"" . it is also not overrated . most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish . it is , however , not boring rubbish . after a terrorist steals a virus , he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter , and the chemicals leak into the ground . the terrorist , who has been exposed to the nasty concoction , hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie . one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady . once she is bitten , lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose . as usual for a fulci flick , the acting is atrocious , the storyline is riddled with plot holes , and the gore is plentiful . turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei , so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature . it is badly shot , too , poorly edited , and the sound design is flat . still , it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing . definitely worth picking up if you are an undead completest . or do not like ""gone with the wind"" , undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time .",0,4

"a lot of the comments people have made strike me as ( sorry ) missing the point . kasdan wants to present life , simply , ordinary life . the conventionally structured story , where characters have insights that change their lives , and then fade out , music up , and the film is over , is absorbed into this much larger canvas . several characters in this movie have just such illuminations , and then they move on . sometimes they can hold onto their insights , sometimes they cannot , and that is the way life really is . in other words , kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life there is no happy ending , only an eventual ending; and everything before that is still in process , still always up for grabs and , if you absolutely insist on a theme , an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives . what is a miracle ? well , life itself , for a start . then add in all the random incidents and cross-connections that make up a life , or several interconnected lives , and you have miracles by the bucketful . kasdan underscores this theme lightly , rather than insisting on it , and bolsters it in various ways , most memorably by the device , right in the center of the film , of having mac and his wife , lying in bed , each dreaming their own dreams , but as well showing , later on in the film , how those dreams have the power , within the film , to shape reality . this is not a film with an easy or obvious message . you just have to let it play out in front of you , and then let it sit in your mind for a few days , a month , a few years , and see what it has wrought there . this is , without a doubt , kasdan's best film , his most mature , his most humane . a major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors . the tragedy is , of course , that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now , mostly due to studio constraints around ""dreamcatcher .

"first things first , edison chen did a fantastic , believable job as a cambodian hit-man , born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring , where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive , living on the mantra of kill or be killed . in a role that had little dialogue , or at least a few lines in cambodian/thai , his performance is compelling , probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog , where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting , and on someone else's leash . like danny the dog , the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically , but rather designed as normal , brutal fisticuffs , where everything goes . this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats , in defending their own lives while taking it away from others . it's a grim , gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively , and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production . edison plays a hired gun from cambodia , who becomes a fugitive in hong kong , on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry . leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu-fai , who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti ( sam lee ) , who is inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father . so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kong . the story itself works on multiple levels , especially in the character studies of the hit-man , and the cop . on opposite sides of the law , we see within each character not the black and white , but the shades of grey . with the hit-man , we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl ( pei pei ) , bringing about a sense of maturity , tenderness , and revealing a heart of gold . the cop , with questionable tactics and attitudes , makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done . there are many interesting moments of moral questioning , on how anti-hero , despicable strategies are adopted . you'll ask , what makes a man , and what makes a beast , and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us , transforming from man to dog , and dog to man ? dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end , though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag , especially on its tender moments , and it suffered too from not knowing when to end . if i should pick a favourite scene , then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered , a suspenseful edge of your seat moment . listen out for the musical score too , and you are not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs . highly recommended , especially if you think that you have seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre .",1,8
"i have no idea how a texan ( the director , douglas mcgrath ) and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms . paltrow was in the first place ! i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar-winning ""shakespeare in love"" performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse . she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this . of course , she is surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette , greta scacchi , juliette stevenson et al . . . jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest , even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow ( in the process , allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship ) ; several years on , ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and , personally , i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays . but the standout is , without a doubt , sophie thompson ( sister of emma thompson , daughter of phyllida law ) as miss bates; what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates , as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn . the film is worth watching ( again even ) for her performance alone . all in all , this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system . well worth a rental ( because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again--but we will always have emma ) .",1,10
"if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood , let it be boy . but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio . after having watched such a good movie as arisan ( 2003 ) , it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia . it seems that the only idea is to make money , but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment . that it is a 'global' world does not seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia . and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west , they get away with it . ok , the story is nice to begin with . and it could have developed into a nice flick . but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback , and secondly good choreography ? in this movie , the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema . every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback , and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie . the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics , but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical . . . they only forgot to change the choreography . it is hardly dancing you see , they jump here and there , throw their legs up in the air , and that is about it . well , at least there is a happy ending . . . . but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic , do so !",0,1

"then you must see this film , to understand the reality . having read the book , ms . duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder; formerly labeled manic-depression . it is hard to believe that in this day and age , people still critique others with emotional problems , or those who seek psychiatric help . regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists , and this is unfortunate . in this film , the audience sees the pain and suffering ms . duke had been through , especially as a child . many of us may remember her from the teenage ""patty duke show"" . she was a household name in america by age 15 . you learn of her exploitation by the ross' ( well played by howard hesseman ) . as she was growing up in the 1950's , the stigma was in full-force . however , we see as she advances in her career , yet the illness becomes worse . she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone whom she divorces the next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother . all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy , and medication . a recent survey released by nami ( national alliance on mental illness ) recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder . it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to .

"brutal , emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963; on october 30 , 1978 , he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield , illinois . he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist ( donald pleasence ) who knows just how evil this young man is . it opens with a bang , and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire . it's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were; subtle , and scary . it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings . how many movies are there , really , that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before ? not very many . pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; jamie lee curtis , in her motion picture debut , became a bona fide scream queen after acting in ""halloween"" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures , and she is an intended victim worth rooting for . co-writer / director john carpenter knows what works in this movie , making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall . with this picture , he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels , many imitators , and an upcoming ""re-imagining"" . it's very quotable - who could ever forget dr . loomis' ( pleasence ) speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff ( charles cyphers , a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter's earlier works ) ? it's fantastic , and worth seeking out . this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time . it's not totally infallible - there are script holes , after all - but overall it makes a solid impact . 9/10",1,9

"the traditional western is synonymous with wide open spaces , clearcut morality , inevitable storylines , the optimistic faith in a hero's ability to shape his own destiny , to escape his past . these qualities reflect directly the american sense of self , the self-shaping dream , the pushing of boundaries and frontiers , which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians . with some noble exceptions ( eg wellman , hawks ) , the western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety . anthony mann changed all that forever , and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent , vivid , complex , not to say exciting westerns ever made . the traditional western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged wholesomeness , whatever misfortunes he may have had in the past , a supporter of order and right , who dominates the film , removes its obstacles , restores harmony in effect; and an obvious villain , who often , ironically , drives the plot , forces the hero into certain actions . the difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats . mann's background was in film noir , a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism . noir was neurotically charged , focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist , where morality is blurred , the hero is as often the villain , trapped in an interior-labyrinth of his own making , a passive victim to destiny . noir is about regress not progress , the interrogating and denying of modes and signs of representation , not the creation and confirmation of them . winchester 73 is fraught with noir anxiety . noir is often considered a psychological genre , visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head . 73 does this too , and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely , homespun jimmy stewart , initiating here his great run of difficult films with mann and hitchcock . in many ways , good-natured and sweet , representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order , he is also a near-lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge , whose relentless quest mirrors ethan edwards in the searchers in its inhuman persistance , whose human instincts are frayed by this quest , and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness . as in noir , his anxiety has a psychological base - unlike most 'healthy' heroes who have outgrown ( symbolically killed ) their fathers , mcadam's father was killed before he could complete the process; his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an anguished protest against stunted growth . the climactic shoot-out is not cathartic : mcadam staggers back into 'normal' society , like he is just witnessed some of the world's most ghastly horrors . what is most unsettling about the film is that it is not really about a hero or a villain at all , but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action . 73 opens with the gun of the title privileged , on display behind a glass window , while its admirers are trapped , squashed , undifferentiated , framed , admiring it outside . throughout the film , human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of signifiers - names change; lin and dutch mime shooting each other because they have no guns; quests lose their moral vitality and their practitioners veer close to madness; armies have to ask for help from confederate strangers to fight battles; a man becomes worthy of respect only when he mentions his name; another man is revealed as a coward when he abandons his fiancee to the indians; the gun retains its prestige , power , wholeness . it's not the revenge plot which drives the film , but the story of the gun; this wrenches the film out of conventional expectations , and creates an eerie , alienating , modern feel . we become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow , with the gun , another plot entirely , we feel slightly bewildered . this emphasis on the gun , symbol of potent masculinity , actually allows for a critique of that masculinity , revealing pointless elaborate rituals at the expense of society and order; brute capitalist greed; murderous indian-traders who defraud both seller and enemy; cowards; psychotic killers; before returning to its 'true' owner , a broken hero thoroughly compromised , who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks . the gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner , not only because there is no fixed owner , but because there is no fixed masculinity , an insight anathema to the traditional western . 73 brilliantly invokes western myths - wyatt earp , dodge city , the cavalry , the civil war , the wide open west - only to undermine them . earp has an inflated reputation that is all name but never proven - dodge city is no safer against outlaws than anywhere else; the cavalry is inept ( custer has just lost little big horn ) and the bitter feud of the war is shown to be irrelevant . the myth of the open west is a site for a very closed , inescapable , circular plot which traps its characters , refuses to allow them shape their destiny , but allowing it to shape them . the old john ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised , but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity . but for all its deconstruction , the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few westerns ever achieve . mann's incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions , alternating revealing distance with intense examination , making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in .",1,9
"as far as i can recall , balanchine's alterations to tchaikovsky's score are as follows : 1 ) the final section of the grossvatertanz ( a traditional tune played at the end of a party ) is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over . 2 ) a violin solo , written for but eliminated from tchaikovsky's score for the sleeping beauty , is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene . balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter . 3 ) the solo for the sugar plum fairy's cavalier is eliminated . it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovsky's great score is misplaced .",1,9

"moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family ! before the real story of the movie starts , we get a performance of the bad tour ( man in the mirror ) , and it kicks off a great movie . after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier , as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 . after a few music videos also ( speed demon , leave me alone , etc . ) the story starts . the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends ( who are kids ) are being chased by the bad guy of the story ""mr . big"" , because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs . during the chase we see fantastic segments , fx . michaels video for smooth criminal , which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences , etc . but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr . big , and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict . during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards , but also impressive today . for instance , see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends ! it's so cool ! the movie ends with a performance of come together ( later published in michaels double-album of history ) , and you leave the movie with a magic feeling . amazing ! i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv . and now some parents might stand up and say : ""but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser !

"it's amazing that from a good , though not wonderful , film made back in the early nineties , a whole franchise can grow . 'stargate; sg1' is , without a doubt , a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi . following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate' , this series sees stargate command ( a military/science organisation ) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore . sg1 is one such team , headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill , and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson , military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c , who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people . earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld , a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods . the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life . richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill , who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye . michael shanks , as daniel , brings heart and an will of steel to the character , who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed . amanda tapping , as carter , has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong , intelligent military scientist . christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c , who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety . and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness . almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence , reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs ( often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson ) . guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that does not bore viewers . sg1 also excels in humour , from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd ! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death . it is not just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show , overall .",1,9
"the film portrays france's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western ( francophone ) africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman , france ( herein symbolically representing her nation ) . it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past , in particular , and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded . this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling ( or being in transit ) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities . the characters all play a symbolic , albeit a limited and unconvincing role . france , meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society , leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naivet she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality . the rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable . the black africans are , to say the least , offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material . they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like france wonders seeking a world she never knew , and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon .",0,1

"'the italian' is among the great or near-great films of 1915 that are available today . the year was a turning point for the feature-length film , especially in america : lois weber's 'hypocrites' , cecil b . demille's 'the cheat' and , of course , d . w . griffith's 'the birth of a nation' set new benchmarks for the art . additionally , that year , russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures , 'after death' and 'daydreams' . the french serial 'les vampires' also has its admirers today , although i disagree with them . the emergence of the feature-length film was led by europe , mainly denmark , france and italy , but dominance of this market and , to a degree , the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915 . the most overriding artistic achievement of 'the italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography . there are some picturesque sunsets , mobile framing , including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car , and , in general , there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout . an especially amazing shot is a close-up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up , in reference to d . w . griffith's 'musketeers of pig alley' ( 1912 ) . he's so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger . unfortunately , the cinematographer appears to be unknown . the director , although originally without credit in the film , is now known to have been reginald barker . five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today , but are rather unremarkable . 'civilization' ( 1916 ) , which he worked on , was a large production , but a deeply flawed movie . by the way , i'd guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'civilization' also photographed 'the italian' . moreover , the entire production is very advanced for then . venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles ( for romanticized venice ) and san francisco ( for the ethnic slums of new york ) . there are extensive flashbacks , although perhaps one or two too many . i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor , george beban , who is also the lead in the inner , main narrative . the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes , la the theatre , which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child's room , with the opening and closing of window curtains . parallel editing , in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly . additionally , beban and clara williams , as his wife , play their parts well . on the other hand , 'the italian' does have a few drawbacks . the film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama , although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works well mostly because it is supported by the lighting and photography . the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film , enhanced by the stark photography , must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie-going public back then . the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more; his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian's revenge . in addition , the filmmakers were either medically na f or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child . aside from the deficiencies in plot , 'the italian' is exceptionally well made .",1,8
"i honestly believe that anyone considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure . like the ""films"" of edward wood , jr . in the '60s and '70s , this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts , re-editing their films , and reworking their special effects until they finally look right . this movie is also a decent argument for the studios' pre-screening process . if mr . hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience , perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes . film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is ""good enough"" can truly be . every performance , every line of dialog , every digital effect , every filter effect , indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity . a beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think ""at least i accomplished something"" or ""just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself"" . this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out . critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment ""the worst movie ever made"" . beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are , and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites . also , beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay , and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story . writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think ""i can do better than that"" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results . i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers . particularly those entering the craft in this current post-lucas and post-spielberg environment . there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects . the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off . some cannot even come close to it .",0,1
"a hit at the time but now better categorised as an australian cult film . the humour is broad , unsubtle and , in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it , crude . contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian pilgrimage to 'the old country' , and every cliche about those rapacious , stuck up , whinging , tory brits . would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors , and to australians of that generation , who can 'get' the humour . americans -- forget it . the language and jokes are in the australian dialect of english and as such will be unintelligible .",1,9
"my comments for vivah : - its a charming , idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao . the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor , playing games together , their friendly banter and mutual respect . vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals . yes , the central romance is naively visualized . but the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism . the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom , on the wedding night , tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries : ""come let me do your dressing"" v i v a h - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage , beauty of indian culture , beauty of indian woman , last but not least a nice idealism of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married . . . . playing by the rules ! simple yet beautiful; such a simple story . . . . no plot . . . no villain - as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films . sooraj sir is back to what he does best . he has made the movie with full conviction . its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage & the union of 2 families . i think amrita rao - looks very good & she has acted very well . she has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance . i also liked the acting of all others for ex . the choti i . e . amrita prakash , alok nath , anupam kher , shahid's bro & sis-in-law . it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could . sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya , hahk & hum saath saath hain . the chemistry between shahid & amrita is awesome . stuff like sanctity in a marriage/relationship , avoiding courtship , mutual respect , care & space , waiting for getting married ""officially"" , praying/sacrficing for ur beloved - all these and more get showcased in vivah . there's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film . some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing , that they r thinking bout arranged-marriage : ) thats success if you ask me . it seems amrita rao - our actress-from-vivah {result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006 ! ! hats off to her for this achievement chalo , even though vivah , shahid or amrita did not get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to cheer about ! ! congrats to amrita rao- for showing us a visual of indian bride-to-be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way : ) shudn't forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today ! ! imagine , to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar . . . . . . . . . . its no mean achievement ! ! congrats to amrita rao - for taking her career to another level with this award . . . . i personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur ! ! they make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {srk-kajol} or {aamir khan & juhi chawla} . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . some points that i observed , few of the elements : - #1 if u notice carefully , amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses . she gives every bit of the indian woman essence - in this film ! ! perfect fit #2 shahid kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage . . . . but prem listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his dad - having full faith in anupam kher . eventually ""honesty"" & ""trust"" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita . most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person . but according to what i saw in this film , i have a feeling - that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also , its possible ! ! ! #3 in the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid & amrita are together - or shown to be together . its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where hero & heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff . but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences : - characterized by restraint , innocence & respect for the other ! #4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath & amrita rao . these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of india . #5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes , songs are beautifully pictured ! ! words like ""jal"" , ""praarthana"" e . t . c . are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film : ) personally , i really am fond of many dialogs in this film . #6 last but not the least - the entire hospital scene where shahid puts ""sindhoor"" to amrita when shes struggling for life - is terrific . those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love/i-cant-do-without-u ; its a hats-off feeling ! ! ! *** in many ways , vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya , ddlj , qayamat se qayamat tak , hum dil de chuke sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the lead pair : ) : ) *** if u ask me : - along with films like rang de basanti , lage raho munnabhai , dor , corporate and kabul express , v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 . in fact - i think vivah does deserve better viewing/business than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !

"a truly dreadful film . i did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake american ones . why did it need to be set n america anyway ? - it could have been set in nz and then the actors could have used their normal voices . surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents ? a bad bad film . i am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can ? it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segal/willis type action man flick . a total waste of money ! if there was any taxpayer money in this piece of trash , i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the treasury . i am still reeling ( get it ? pun , reeling ! ) at the absolute garbage i have just seen . why did i continue to watch ? well , i am a movie fanatic and cant help , myself !",0,1

"well , on it is credit side ( if it can be said to have one ) , timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h . g . wells' outstanding novella . but other than that - well , to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime . what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged $20 million dollar budget ! timothy hines really does make mr . wood , who was a flawed genius anyway , look like the best filmmaker of all time . the special effects ( i guess you would call them that ) are not even up to computer game standards . the acting is , well , perhaps about dinner theater comparable , and the accents are atrocious . at the risk of sounding offensive , a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is ( especially poor ogilvy ) , well , ahem , . . . gay ! poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside , waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor . hey , the stormtroopers in ""star wars"" had neat white body armor too , and it did not work either , they still got blasted . even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray' ( ? ) , they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance , even when they are theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons , which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing . maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen , being left over from ""jason and the argonauts"" . or was it ""josie and the pussycats"" ? i dunno . the soldiers , presumably because they are 'military' , all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode , like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him . wow ! i loved it ! but the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war , or boer commandos ( which would be more or less correct for the period . perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines ? ) . oddly enough , the character of the curate looks exactly like he is drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble , and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting . oh , yeah . musn't forget the thunder child . in the book , the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram . it was meant to ram enemy ships . yet , it is bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker-toy constructed martian war machines , with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak , and she sank . an ironclad warship like thunderchild could have rammed the titanic and survived , but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own military . the costumes are all wrong , especially the british army and police uniforms , cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas . and timbo , in an obvious homage to western films of yore , has obviously set his movie in wild western england , because all his riders are using western saddles . the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre , and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky . on the credit side , and contrary to what one reviewer wrote , the only genuine , authentic feature of this thing is the artillery . the guns are not from the civil war , but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders , perfectly authentic to the period . so was the ammunition shown being used . but the artilleryman , who is a driver in the horse artillery , was not shown correctly driving his limber . you do not sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team , you ride the nearside wheel horses . the opening , using what i believe is authentic period film footage , is okay , and the score's not bad . however , to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground , and it certainly did not in 1898 . but growing up reading this novel , i am very disappointed . even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's zillion dollar , special effects laden version . maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise , and vice versa . i have a lot more to say , but i'll let it go at this for now : i wish somebody would make a good version of ""war of the worlds"" that is faithful to the original . timmy's vision is fine for a high school film class , or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student , and about as bad , which is about the best i can say for this thing , but that is about it . oh , yeah . just where did the budget go ? and what happened to michael caine ? i'd like to hear his comments ! i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo ""orson wood"" hines' breathtaking , bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director's ticket to cult stardom , because , i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie , which i did not pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me , with no malicious intent that i've been able to determine . i must add here that i thought blackmoon's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement , but an absolute , hysterically funny ( in a good way ) treat to watch . i find it hard to watch master timbo's version after blackmoon . keep it up , tim ! make your own version of ""dune"" , now . it just awaits the hand of a master like you ! and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield ? forget it . it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness ! hey get a life ! timbo is worse than the master ed wood ! i kid you not !",0,1
"i cannot say this is the worst movie ever made , but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters , ( 1 ) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it , and we actually stood in line to get tickets , and ( 2 ) it is still the only ""serious"" film i recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through . once we reached the infamous ( and interminable ) snake fight scene , i think everyone gave up . the only positive i can concede is the lush location shooting . oh , and there is also bo's breasts , although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and does not rate much more than a playboy pictorial . the ""dramatic tension"" in this film is between bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction . the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent ""action"" sequences ever filmed . however , this is one of those films that is bad enough , it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor . definitely the worst film i ever paid to see .",0,1

"1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members . 11 nominations and not a single title : such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list , which is , arguably , not as good ( and i'm half-polish ) . don't get me wrong , schindler was a classic . and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' ( which won that year ) either; but it was , in my mind , a class behind this one : an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i'm not a big cryer . maybe it was the music ( superb ) , or the cinematography ( sumptuous ) , but more likely simply the acting : whoopi , who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; danny glover , who i'd never heard of before; and , of course , oprah . the rest is history; but , at the time : who knew ?",1,10
"a documentary about two rocks bands , spanning a number of years . brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols . what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure . anton newcombe , the main man of brian jonestown massacre , is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues , his friends and rivals the dandy warhols , but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him . sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world . newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan ) . newcombe knows no limits he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments , writes and produces all bjm's music , can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day , has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius , but is also a heavy drugs user , flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity , orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life , and can blow deals as fast as he makes them . bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable . the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe's creativity and do not even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness but the warhols have something that bjm do not the ability to integrate their talents with common sense , the real world , and their market as a mixing pot of talent ( even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe ) and accessibility , they are the very definition of 'cool . ' dig ! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy . at one point , newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols ( in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act' ) only he forgets to tell them it is a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe . by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday' and 'bohemian like you' , newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated . bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time , let off with a warning , and even allowed to keep the grass . the wider appeal of dig ! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music . the downside is that it is still a documentary , however intimate , and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands . newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius , and there are feint glimpses of this in the film , but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this . in the words of one of the band members : ""in every spiritual tradition , you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up . "" newcombe is not pretending but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime , and dig ! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius .",1,8
"'say yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better , but it never does . it's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest , so beloved of straight to video film-makers . the dialogue is clunky and , in several places , poorly translated . the acting is uniformly poor , especially from the villain of the piece , played by joong-hoon park . he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening , when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple . the plot deserves special mention , as it is idiotic beyond all belief . the 'heroes' do not think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them . the 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her . the villain gets past a police checkpoint ( while wearing a shirt covered in blood , and a bloody head bandage ) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving . the villain is punched , clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork , but never seems to be impeded by these , rather serious , injuries . and do not even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending . sheesh . the only plus point in this film , for me , is sang mi chu . who is very pretty , but really no more than a mediocre actress . overall , this film comes off like a poorly written , flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos' , but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved .",0,2
"i respect alex cox the filmmaker , i really do . he's like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be ""different"" , a literary punk-rocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringe-culture and come out into the world ready to take s*** on . . . but then you see what he can actually do , the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him , and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer . but there is two sides to his proverbial coin : he can either really hit it out of the park ( repo man , sid & nancy , walker arguably ) or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat ( straight to hell ) . death and the compass falls into the latter category , and while i respect its ( mostly ) original approach to tackling a detective-killer story , it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull . it has a strange enough set-up and already irreverent style to follow : a detective , erik lonnrot , is after a killer with a hell-fire voice , red ( something ) , and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims : scrawled in blood on the walls are messages that , according to eyewitness alonso zunz ( christopher eccleston looking as if he just walked off shallow grave without changing his look ) has religious significance in the kabbalah . we follow lonnrot on his case , and his methods of going after the perp , which include following at first a triangular and then compass-shaped pattern on the map- this despite the protests of the flabbergasted commissioner treviranus ( miguel sandoval ) , who also looks back in flash-forwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case . oh , cox has his moments of creativity and interest , such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where eccleston's character is taken in by handcuffs ( ""for his own protection"" says lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room ) and we are followed in a long tracking shot- maybe the best or just most curious- where we are taken through very dark hallways with very little direction , lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters . and it is never something that is not fascinating to *look* at , with miguel garzon's cinematography a morbid delight . but the plot goes through hoola-hoops to keep things so off-beat it might as well be beat-less all-together . the performances , save for a confident boyle and for eccleston at the very end , are pretty bad , especially sandoval who just seems to squirm in his seat reciting the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audience . while the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this is not something we have seen before , that it is in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting alphaville's next decrepit wave , it too fizzle's out very quickly . what's the conflict here ? i was never that much engaged with boyle's own personal mission to find this killer , and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer ( and/or killers ) going after people like in the building early on ( cox himself has an amusing cameo ) . and just when i started to think it was leading up to something spectacular , with boyle and eccleston in that big ( ""not as big as you think"" ) building in the south section of the city , it suddenly gives us a ""twist"" that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope is not , and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery it is been leading up to . for all of cox's uncanny touches as a filmmaker , for all of his opposition to spoon-feeding the audience with a 'conventional' approach , which i do respect , death and the compass ultimately cuts one off at the brain-stem; it is masturbatory .",0,4
"i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased . a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re-evaluate waterloo . so i stick orson and rita in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure . on the surface the story seemed a simple one , man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs , they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband , and then . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans . michael o'hara ( orson welles} himself does not really know what is going on , he is as confused as the viewer is , and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film . obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister ( rita hayworth} has its moments , but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped . so many wonderful things in the film , it has welles visual style all over it , see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye . the narration from o'hara is joyously self mocking , and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings . yet the film is an oddity , and in fact it is a choppy viewing experience , because {as i was to find out after} studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour , and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer , but unfair on welles' vision . i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale , as it is tho , we have a very good and intriguing film , one that sadly only hints at greatness , but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i'm glad i own to revisit further . 8 . 5/10",1,8

"the question , when one sees a movie this bad , is not necessarily , ""how did a movie this bad get made ? "" or even , ""why did i see this awful in the first place ?

"" or , ""where are we ?

"regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem ""la b te"" of 1975 , one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience . borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time , and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors . ""la b te"" is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy-tale-like atmosphere , quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise . the fact that beastiality ( of sorts ) is one of the film's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors , but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience . pierre de l'esperance ( guy tr jan ) , the head of a french aristocratic family , has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin ( pierre benedetti ) to marry lucy broadhurst ( lisbeth hummel ) , the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family . due to an old curse , mathurin's uncle ( marcel dali ) is strictly against the wedding . when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate , lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda ( sirpa lane ) , and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings . the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever-dream . . . without giving away too much , i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film . as bizarre as it is , ""la b te"" is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style , settings and cinematography . the fever-dream-like atmosphere is present within- and out of dream-sequences . the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings , and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale . the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic ( elegant female nudity , ravishing actresses ) to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting ( close-ups on horses' genitalia while having intercourse , . . . ) ; in either case it is not likely to be forgotten . the entire cast of ""la b te"" is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters ( some of which are seriously demented ) . the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast , be it lisbeth hummel in the lead , finnish actress sirpa lane ( who sadly died of aids in 1999 ) as the ancestor in the dream-sequences , or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault , who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard . i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed . some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film , the scenes with the eponymous 'beast' definitely being among them . certainly not everybody's cup of tea , but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema . a true cult gem !",1,8
"perhaps the best isabel allende's book , house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history , this one full of magic , a mystic veil , plus some kind of omnipresent sadness . this movie gathers a great cast , plus a great art direction , with a script that cannot contain all this book's quality . it's unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie , whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high , and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset , mostly because they understood very little .",1,10

"if you like star wars/trek , come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices . it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times , other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller . the intensity of the root material ( shakespeare's ""the tempest"" ) is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry ( a la later lucas ) . and just because it was made in 1956 , do not assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up . this was the first movie where you couldn't . miracle it was made at ""a-movie"" scale , economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it . and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was ""lassie come home"" . until i looked him up , i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous , but at the time did not want to be associated with sci-fi , which was strictly a ""b"" genre back then . this was either a very very visionary production , or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood . there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively . there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; ""computers"" , as they have come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works . star trek's 'transporter' is there , visually , almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later . and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off , fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate , even today . the ""ship"" set is comprehensive , sparklingly realistic , as good as anything you have seen since , and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done , for tv or film . we did not get to spend as much time there as i would have liked . if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently , watching fp will explain all that . it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars' .",1,9
"i just got the uk 4-disc special edition of superman 1 for about $5 . the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole-men . so i slapped it into the dvd player last night , and here are my findings . some initial disappointment - i had not checked , and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials . i'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman , and i had not seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho , never mind . this black and white production runs for less than an hour . it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves' early tv series , a two-parter , put together for cinema release , although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series . in any event , it is an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later . i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets , so there were no major surprises here . even so , for a low budget movie , this one is really low budget . the story concerns the small town of silsby - population 1 , 430 - which , puzzlingly , is also home to the world's deepest oil well ( 6 miles ) . the story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down . this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well , at the behest of the oil company . as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down , a couple of odd little guys ( small in stature , big in head , black in jumpsuit , and bushy in eyebrow ) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft , and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces . a deep breath now , here is the remaining plot of the picture . the little guys scare some kids , so jeff corey ( playing the town's rampant xenophobe ) incites some pals to kill these ""creatures"" . superman steps in ( moderately ineffectually ) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital . corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed , but he escapes and legs it down the shaft . corey incites a lynch mob ( despite the sheriff arresting him ) to hang the hospitalised mole-man . superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows . a total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey ( i call this an aargh ! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go ""aargh ! "" ) and superman saves him . he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved , the mole-men go back down the shaft . the end . despite the film only being an hour long , there is an inordinate amount of creeping around , bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the ""mole-man 1 creeps from a to b , looking out to make sure no-one is following him"" stuff . the mole-men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up , get persecuted , and go back . they do look a little creepy , but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies . reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter , much more so than phyllis coates' rather indifferent lois lane . but he is a terrible , terrible superman . not only does he not look the part ( at least his hair is dyed black in this , which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes ) , the way he plays it is all wrong in my book . i'm sure he was told to ""strike the pose"" ( which superman does constantly ) , but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips , not fists on ribs . and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he does not actually wag his finger in remonstration , but he may as well have done . and superman does a huge amount of walking around ( i say a huge amount - he is not actually in it all that much ) , and a bit of running . he takes off and lands a couple of times , but is not seen in flight at any point . oh , some bullets bounce off him , and he uses telescopic vision as clark , but with no accompanying visual effect . in fact , visual effects are conspicuous by their absence , and the few which are present are not very good . i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time : but even by those standards i think it is a pretty threadbare effort . thankfully , production standards on the tv series were higher , and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them . something of a disappointment - i shall not be watching it again .",0,2

"i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that is why i had avoided it . today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do . . . and as it turned out , i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do . vanilla sky is a frightening , sad and touching movie , actually one of the best i've seen in a while . i was surprised by how i was affected watching it . it's hard to explain , but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it is quite an emotional journey . vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie , or any media for that matter . i really recommend everyone to watch this movie . regardless of what you have heard about it .",1,8
"am i wrong , or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original ? i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen . . . . . bad acting , bad editing etc . . . . the only ""exploitation "" aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap . it is nothing more than a light-weight porn flick . . . no real gore , no scary images , just a cheaply done bit of garbage . if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors , some slimy gore and a decent storyline . . . get baby blood . . . also done on a cheap budget but well made . . . and an actual story too ! i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh . . . . it is pathetic ! new comment . . . . sept 3 . . . . . i'll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it is almost good . . . . in a really bad way . . . . the worst acting ever . . . a real crap-movie classic !",0,1
"i saw this film at the rotterdam festival , as did presumably all the other voters . the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project , which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got . it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite ""round the twist"" but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature . the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you are trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states , as i cannot think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic , poorly acted ( albeit by an amateur cast ) and prey to the subaltern mentality . the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over , but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in , all problems can be solved ( by leaving the island ) .",0,3
"when i began watching the muppets take manhattan , the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced i was watching something recent , so you can imagine my surprise when i came to the imdb and read that it was made in 1984 . jim henson may have ended the muppet show when it was at its peak , but spin offs like this and muppet babies ( which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film ) are the absolute nadir of all things muppet . i used to wonder why muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as mr . cranky , so i am glad that the muppets take manhattan ( henceforth : tmtm ) set me straight on that one . of course , many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around : aliens , robocop , the evil dead , even night of the living dead . so while it is no surprise that tmtm is less than the muppet movie or the great muppet caper , the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up tmtm is . not only is the music far less satisfying , the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible . there are , of course , some redeeming and genuinely funny moments , but they are few and far between . the swedish chef is great in any scene he inhabits , so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest . the problem is that there are just no scenes that work . the story , such as it is , revolves around a broadway musical kermit is attempting to get produced . he goes through many trials and tribulations along the way , including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before . the biggest problem is that kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time . charles durning was cinematic gold as doc hopper , the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit kermit for his business . charles grodin was dynamite as nicky holiday , a jewel thief the muppets must fight in order to save miss piggy from a lifetime in prison . the saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist , and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films . charles grodin also highlights what is wrong with tmtm . namely , the music sucks . the opening number of the manhattan melodies show that is at the centre of tmtm , to put it nicely , makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated . i might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me , but songs like the rainbow connection inspired tears of joy , not irritation . grodin's big solo during the great muppet caper , while not having the same resonation , he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own . he is all class . and if there is one thing tmtm could use , it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class . tmtm also feels severely time-compressed , with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion . maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces . see if you can find them in tmtm . while tmtm does have its guest stars , they are either poorly utilised ( brooke shields and john landis ) , or totally out of their element ( liza minelli , dabney coleman ) . to call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery . the absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here , after animal's ""go home"" postscript for the muppet movie in particular . which highlights another problem . the characters are poorly written at best , with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard . animal shouts singular words at times , but they have nothing to do with the plot , or the conversation going on around him . say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters , but think of animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills , or his ""sowwy"" after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow muppets . now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual muppet other than swedish chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn . give up ? then you have proved my point . given that labyrinth , one of the henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the muppets , arrived some two years later , it makes tmtm all the more puzzling . perhaps this misfire convinced jim henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage . or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to frank oz , who at the time had just finished working with george lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original star wars saga . the writers were also involved with the great muppet caper , so i will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film . the production is also substantially improved here , with muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them . had the story and script been better thought-out , tmtm might have been at least comparable to the great muppet caper . as it stands now , it is a great answer to the question of whether muppets write under the influence , or excrete . for that reason , i gave the muppets take manhattan a three out of ten . two to denote its actual quality , and a bonus for the swedish chef's moments . without him , this film would be unwatchable .",0,3
"rohinton mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion , emotion , humour and pathos . the story is somewhat slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience . the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy . all of the actors are indian - few if any known to ""western"" audiences - but they are a joy to behold , especially the little girl who acts very convincingly . don't be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen . we have much to learn from it .",1,10
"i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews . the movie is not great , but it has a lot of great elements . the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great . the story is slow and weak , but entertaining . the acting is bad , but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel . the music is pretty good and the gore is good . it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell . i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable , it was still enjoyable . the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy . the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up . there was no sex scenes . i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair . i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do . the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film , the devil is quite creepy .",1,7
"this flick reminded me of those lame ""erotic thrillers"" i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13 . i'd label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder . there is , however , a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club , we see kane hodder's keester ( or at least a stunt butt ) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster's for a costume . 13 year old boys rejoice . other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i've seen in years . the shots look like fmv's from the video game resident evil in terms of quality . the wolf is too bad to be explained and , despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way , way too many times . the plot and acting make no sense . there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do- look human , change to a wolf an kill people . the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly cannot find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches . once more , this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched , met or even saw as best i can tell . the mate does not know she is a werewolf and she is fighting the transformation or something . you'd think it would be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but , well they did . want quality low-end werewolf-ism , go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t&a this is your flick .",0,2
"this film seems to be completely pointless . there is no reason why anything that happens in it happens , as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought ""how can i wrap this up ?

"this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family . it does not seem to know whether to be an ""a"" or a ""b"" western . i mean , the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god's sake . william boyd must be spinning in his grave . all the ""b"" western cliches are here . the two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed ( ""c'mon thunder"" ) , the all-in-black bearded villain , the heroine in distress , the rancher in trouble , the cowardly sheriff , over the top bad guys etc . the acting , with few exceptions , is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting . chris lybbert ( who ? ) as the hero and louis schweibert ( who ? ) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's poverty row quickie . the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen , robert carradine , clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little , but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one . what was the point of the martin sheen/robert carradine framing sequences ? are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost ? what was the purpose of the black gloves ? it just did not make sense . being a great lover of westerns from all genres , i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film . the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic . aside from the hero and main villain , the other characters looked authentic . if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character , they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder , the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in . what else can i say but . . on thunder , on big fellow .",0,3

"philo vance ( william powell ) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show . usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries ( like this ) but i love this movie . it moves very quickly ( only 72 minutes ) , is beautifully directed by michael curtiz ( he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along ) , has a very ingenious story line ( including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible ) and has a very good cast . powell is very suave and great as vance--he does not seem to be acting--he is vance ! mary astor is not given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production . everybody else is very good too , but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath . he's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious . basically , an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery . well worth seeing .",1,10
". . . you cannot exactly shove her out of the way , because she is old; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with is not really her fault . nevertheless , in these circumstances it is often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake . so it is with ""the pallbearer"" , an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong; sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral . to further extend the metaphor ( perhaps unwisely ! ) ; like the old lady , one starts to feel with the set-up of the film that its demise cannot be far away . sure enough , this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted , slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments , as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction : downhill . its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again , not unlike the grim inevitability of death ! returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels' , the main character , tom , is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life . if there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic' , then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of schwimmer's other - more famous - role . to find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even more 'clueless' than ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as schwimmer , but i guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place . how will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he is picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable' , even if the situations are not ? a man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he has not seen for years . sound familiar . . . ? paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'rachel' role , but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present were not so incongruous as well . unfortunately , the romantic element is so well-worn it is threadbare , and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff' . . . ! 2/10 .",0,2

"it's hard for me to assign the ""fair"" number of stars to this film , but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was , in 1968 , an innovative approach to the war film . remember too that i have not seen it since 1969 . but it did make a strong impression . the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made . it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944-45 . no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail , and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves . there is no preaching , no sentimentality , no comic relief , no complicated scenarios . unfortunately , there is no subtlety either . partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat , familiar clich 's . as ""entertainment , "" the film does not make it , though it was clearly not intended to ""entertain .

"if the makers of atlantis had something to say in this film , its theme was ( literally ) drowned out by the emphasis on ""special effects"" over characterization . almost as if in an attempt to ""keep up"" with the rest of the summer action blockbusters , disney has ditched the character-driven , movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a star wars ""shoot-'em-up"" with stereotype heroes and villains . the art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images ( cgi ) of flying fish-craft and submarines to fill the gap . they are wrong , and the days of beautiful , handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line cgi . this movie is all spectacle with no heart . at times the film comes close to being a good , worthwhile movie , but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz . another problem with the movie is the pacing . it starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated . the viewer is rushed out of the door along with milo thatch ( voiced well by michael j . fox ) and is left thinking ""gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that is going to happen once we get to atlantis"" . unfortunately , not much happens . the secret of atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent . they are afraid to commit to saying where atlantis is , even in a fictional story . is it in the atlantic ? is it in the mediterranean sea ? who knows ? nothing is hypothesized , even from a purely fantasy-based point of view . the viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves ""now what was that all about ? what was the point of the movie ? why could not the surviving atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the ""present"" day ? and why did atlantis sink ? "" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw . there is nothing left to think about or mill over . . . except the loss of money in their wallets . the characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable . from the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 , to the ( spoiler ) collective consciousness that enters kida and voluntarily deserts its people ! ? ! the crew are a collection of quirky , 2-dimensional people of anachronistically ( for 1914 ) p . c . race and gender . the demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a warner brothers' bugs bunny short . most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons : they are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled . the way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe . while we applaud disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first disney not to have cute , talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition . younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles ( when the characters speak atlantean ) . in the first five minutes of the expedition , approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought . obviously disney thinks that if you did not know who those people were , then why should you care ? again , the movie has no feelings on any level . mulan and tarzan were the last animated movies produced by disney that were done extremely well . sadly , atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the black cauldron and hunchback of notre dame . disney needs to get back to their roots . a sequel to peter pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself . and now that disney has discovered science fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it . we also hope that the upcoming ""treasure planet"" , a sci-fi adaptation of robert l . stevenson's ""treasure island"" , will have more heart to it than the unfathomable ""atlantis : the lost empire"" .",0,2

"this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster ( jimmy stewart ) and ronda castle ( ruth roman ) . she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway , and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder . they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction . neither trusts a member of the opposite sex , apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them . gradually , they learn to trust each other , as they journey from skagway to dawson . but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway . she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff . meanwhile , rene , a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff , but only gets insulting brush offs in return . yet , she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson . along with ronda , she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim . walter brennan , as ben , serves as jeff's long time sidekick . he does not have a meaty role , but serves to soften jeff's hard edges . his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff . john mcintire ( as sheriff gannon ) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film , oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying . evidently , he sees something of himself in jeff , repeatedly declaring that he is going to like him . he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith , who spent his last years in skagway , as one of the premier con men of his times . jeff is the quintessential antihero , a loner ( except for companion ben ) , who does not want to stick his neck out for others , even when he knows he is the one right man for the job . in this respect , he closely resemble's burt lancaster's character in ""vera cruz"" , for example . thus , jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson , he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims , while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson . even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive . then , jeff has a sudden change of heart , apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself . he changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon's gang from dawson . in this respect , he differs from lancaster's character , who never reforms ( but is jeff truly changed , or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests ? ) the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women . clearly , ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff . although she is clearly characterized as a ""bad"" girl , jeff has a checkered recent past himself , having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon , and having stolen his cattle back from gannon . ironically , soon after jeff changes from anti-hero to hero , rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon's impending ambush . she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she did not just look out for herself ( his supposedly just abandoned creed ! ) . it's clear that corine calvert , as renee , just does not make a credible substitute for the dead ronda , in jeff's mind . yet , the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together , even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug . her image as a good , if naive , young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust , pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later . i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris , a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her . ( he's not her father ) . another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon's gang . if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol , he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk , before jeff did the same to him . and how did jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease ? i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims . they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow . and why were not most of ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche ? you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon's gang . the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action . all-in-all , a very entertaining western , with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end . no doubt , this film takes some great liberties with history and geography , especially , the part taking place in the canadian yukon , which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway .",1,8
"i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one . altman's touch with zooms in and out were there , and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations . unfortunately , as far as i could see , they sometimes were gratuitous , sometimes witty , often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection . in particular , two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed . to be fair , though , a few zooms ( outs and ins ) to branagh heightened his character's increasing bewilderment , a la pudgy mccabe's or philip marlow's . on the whole , the zooms were , well , inconsistent , and sometimes even trite . other almanesque devices , such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject , succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge . car windshields , house windows , and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently , i felt , harking back to the player and even the long goodbye . a few catchy jump-cuts , especially to a suggestive tv commercial , reminded me of such usage in short cuts , to sardonic effect . but finally , the mismatch between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum , failed to excite me . this director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres , including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around , the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre . was he muzzled in by mammonist producers , perhaps ? or am i missing something , due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here ? nonetheless , the casting was excellent all around : tom berenger ( for his terrifying ferality ) , branagh for his ( deflated ) hubris , robert downey jr's pheromonal haze , robert duvall's method of trash , and davidtz's lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all . and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of ( brunette ? ) daryl hannah , accents were convincingly southern . suspense and mood were engrossing , even if the story did not quite rivet viewers . the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely , painstakingly rendered--i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto . torn , in the end i judged it a 7 .",1,7
"the beginning of the 90s brought many ""quirky"" and ""off-beat"" independent films , a particular sub-genre of which is the semi-spiritual desert crime movie . others of note are ""wild at heart"" , ""from dusk til dawn"" , and to a certain extent ""natural born killers"" . good films like those spawned junk like ""highway 666"" , ""destiny turns on the radio"" and this ineptly surreal anti-masterpiece ""under the hula moon"" . it's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone , attains it , but keeps going to the point of irritation . while the pursuit across the spirit-world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas , the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie , and is not focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy . i will not blow the ending , but let us just say it is bad . the film is basically a bad side effect of genre-cancer . this is the dregs of indie-mania .",0,1
"the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue , south american politics and super-natural powers . meryl streep , glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense . this , in my view , is one of the best films of the 1990s . jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably , while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle , loving warmth throughout her relatively short life . winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture . glenn close , as esteban's sister , gives a very moving performance . the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country . settings of clara's home and esteban's ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere .",1,9
"one of the worst films i have ever seen . how to define ""worst ? "" i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again . somehow , one-hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans , mary kay saleswomen , las vegas , gays , fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy , sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed . how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be ""the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one"" is beyond me . the worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script : in 1958 , elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted ! worst special effect ? that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis' grave , potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world , resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere . potentially , this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans . however , the rampant stupidity ( nixon gave elvis a dea badge , not fbi credentials . . . and i could go on and on ) actually undercuts that conventional wisdom . ugh . i used the word ""wisdom"" to describe this stupid movie . this is truly a horrible , horrible film .",0,1
"some things need to be clarified . the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie . i know that because he was my dad . please remove that picture . also , mark ferris was the writer , at least one of them . i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again . it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy , that would be great . the movie was not all that bad , and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile . if you watch it , just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses . lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films .",0,4
"i just watched this movie and i've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there ! ! ! a friend lent me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story . well , the movie started off with kevin costner as a fighter pilot retiring . . . why ? why did they make him a fighter pilot ? he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony quinn's character to be his new pilot . . . well , we never see costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie ! costner runs into a texan ( james gammon ) selling a horse to a big mexican businessman and costner tags along for a ride . without knowing what happened , gammon is beat to near death and costner drives him to the meeting , which happens to be with an associate of quinn ! but , nothing comes of it . . . nada , zilcho ! why did they have gammon's character ? why did they have the horse sale with the quinn associate if nothing was to come of it ? also , after they leave costner for dead , they make madeline stowe's character become a whore , then she attacks one of quinn's men that was paying for a turn . . . she stabs him with his own knife , and the next thing she is been moved to a convent ! no explanation as to why she was moved , or when it was done ! too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing ! ! i only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it . . . i'm going to throw it at him for the 2 hours i wasted of my life watching the blasted thing !",0,3
"not wishing to give *anything* away here , i would just say this technically excellent , flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment : it will amuse , surprise , possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time , as it approaches the inevitable , but not obvious , ending without becoming clich d or predictable in any way . most definitely recommended . a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham-carter's outstanding performances - i agree entirely . . . .",1,8
"i found grey garden's to be a gripping film , an amazingly intimate look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea : forget society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge brood of cats and raccoons , persuing their own interests rather mundainly , all the while chattering at the camera . big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros . have chosen to document . they seem like characters out of a fellini film , only stranger , if that makes any sense . old edie is almost fully bedridden , a pile of papers , clothes and dirty dishes growing around her . little edie is even more interesting . she prances around the house , always wearing a baboushka-like headdress around her head , completely covering her hair . we never see her hair throughout the film , nor do we ever get a hint that she still has much . at age fifty eight , though , she is still beautiful and full of life . in grey gardens , we get the sense that both of these women's lives have become much less than what they once were . little edie is probably the sadder of the two . while her mother , in her earlier years , got married , made a family , lived luxuriously and even made some recordings ( the scene where , at 77 , she sings along with a recording of ""tea for two"" she made decades ago is one of the films best scenes ) , edie left her promicing career as a model to take care of her ailing mother . at 58 , she still longed to find her prince charming . if anything little edie is still a little girl , full of dreams of glamour and fame , and of domestic and romantic bliss , that have yet to be fulfilled . highlights of the film include the opening moments , where little edie explains her outfit to the camera , the ""tea for two"" sequence , the birthday party , the climactic argument , the grocery deliver scene , and the scene in the attic . the whole thing is incredibly candid and unpretencious . and it is made all the more remarcable since it is all real . i suggest seeing grey gardens back-to-back with the kenneth anger short puce moment . the criterion dvd is $35 . 00 , but it is worth every penny .",1,10
"this ""movie"" is such a bad work ! nothing seems to even try and be realistic . plot is weak , acting - miserable , actors wondering around like in a 1st year production , trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . what a flop ! what a waste of time , money and effort to all concerned including the audience . well , as in any thriller , here too are murders , corpses and blood . just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago , committed a murder with a knife , and came out calm and smiling , not to mention clean as a whistle , as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent . also , this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male , and she cut his throat ! ! ! did she ask him , politely , to bend down for her ? much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . continuity is another huge problem as for instance : the eager-hungry groom is lying in bed , waiting for his virgin-bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while , falls asleep ( ! ? ! ) . next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area , asking for guidance to scenery spots ! not a word about last night ? ? ? such a waste of time even to try and write about this low-low supposed-to-be ""movie"" .",0,1
"to ""bend it like beckham"" may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football ( soccer ) , but to english sports fans , it is equivalent to ""hit it like bonds"" or ""dunk it like jordan . "" any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal , much like star player david beckham does , much like the young indian girl , jess ( parminder nagra ) , does in the film bend it like beckham . jess loves to play pick up soccer games , the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother . however , while playing one day , a passing friend named jules ( keira knightley ) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling , all girls soccer team . after satisfying the coach joe ( jonathan rhys-meyers ) , she makes the team , something she knows her mother would not approve of . the movie is not about disobeying parents , but rather a girl doing what she wants to do , even if that goes against culture , not just the parents . there is humor thrown throughout the movie , especially when jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian . the movie does resort to a bit of a clich moment , as the big soccer game is the same day as jess' sister's wedding , but it does not come off a cheesy , but rather fun and light . the soccer action looks good , so sports fans will enjoy it , and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world , the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience . bend it like beckham is not just about soccer , but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time , something that proves to be rather difficult .",1,7
"i bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . i got none of them . this film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film-making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . honestly , it is truly laughable . i could hardly sit through this total garbage once; i certainly will never want to watch it again . don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . if i could give it minus stars , i would .",0,1

"after seeing the poster from the film smother , i knew i was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out . however , i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the movie . unfortunately that did not happen . smother is a horrible movie , but it is not execrable . that is the best i can say about it . the screenplay from smother ( written by the same guys from license to wed , something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies ) is full of cheap and predictable humor . seriously , i did not laugh even once watching this film . besides , the solid cast i previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . after the big number of garbage she has been involved in ( like the monumentally atrocious and execrable because i said so ) , some people may think the career from diane keaton is extinguishing . however , it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades , on films like annie hall or baby boom . on smother , she makes her best effort with her performance , but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it . dax shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films baby mama and idiocracy . however , he does what he can with his character . mike white also makes a good effort , but he does not reach too far away . he is a very talented screenwriter ( like he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock ) , so i would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie , instead of only acting on it . liv tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors : being wasted . the worst fail from smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny . its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit-coms . stay far away from this crappy comedy .",0,4

"the title overstates the content of this movie somewhat , which might lead to some unrealized expectations . frankly speaking , there is very little ""panic in the streets"" to be seen here . in fact , throughout the movie very few people actually know that there is a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters . having said that , what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway ( because , unlike the people ""in the streets"" , the viewer knows what is going on ) and that director elia kazan builds very deliberately . as the plague-infected killer is sought , one of the more interesting sidebars i found was the developing relationship between dr . reed ( richard widmark ) and police captain warren ( paul douglas ) . at the beginning , the two really do not like each other , even though they have to work together . by the end , they have forged a real bond of respect for each other . kazan did a good job with that . pretty much all the performances here were excellent . widmark and douglas were great , and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical ""heavy"" role . i found very little to criticize here . perhaps barbara bel geddes came across as a little bit flat as reed's wife nancy , but her role was not really central to the story . all in all , an excellent piece of work . 9/10",1,9

"""dressed to kill"" , is one of the best thrillers ever made . its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults . brian de palma , once again , proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story . he directs many scenes without dialog , and he tells much of his story , strictly through the use of his visuals , and pino donnagio's brilliant score . filmed in panavision , the film must be seen in widescreen , as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story . cropped , on video , ""dressed to kill"" , is barely the same movie . solid performances from its cast , superb direction , and , perhaps , the finest film score ever written , make ""dressed to kill"" a must see .",1,10

"i've watched this movie twice now on dvd , and both times it did not fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude . it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare , especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed . even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint , it does not fail to question it , and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost , not matter what , and cruelty is a common denominator . what really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize . nowadays truly good movies ( in a nutshell ) are few and far apart , with mainstream fare being enjoyable ( if you do not have high expectations ) , but terribly commercially spirited . i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie ( without being a masterpiece ) , because it sticks to itself , and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it , instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence . this movie is cool , observant , and generally light-handed in its judgement , which is good . the story has its flaws , especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully , but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic , that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life , even by liberally taking each next guy . still she does not come off as weak , in fact i think she is one of the stronger characters , she is always in control of the relationships , with the men just tagging . and i take it very gratefully that she is not a weeping widow . i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now . you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries , so the prospect of of someone dying , while surely causing grief , did not traumatise people like it does now . people did not seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now , and i like that attitude . my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie , if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare . don't watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion .",1,9

"one word : supurrrrb ! i do not think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television . watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs . i have to say i had my reservations . after all , critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show . but when half an hour was over ( by the way , thank you , nbc , for running a commercial-free show ) , i was left with the feeling of instant love , love at first glance , the true love that one feels in his guts . everything about this show screamed excellence . graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek . no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed . cast was marvelous . i am partial to john goodman's voice , but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john . special mention : lisa kudrow's guest appearance . she was on top of the game creating neurotic , pudgy , and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her . ( panda from brooklyn ? only in this show . ) script was funny , with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp , yet not tacky . a note for all parents : this is not for children . this show was never advertised as such , and there is a reason why it is set for 9pm , not 8pm . so if you would like to complain about ""objectionable context"" , save your breath . adults deserve a comedy made just for them , and father of the pride is it . not everything was perfect . i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy's characters . do i sense ""stereotype"" when it comes to them ? yes , they are gay . yes , they are flamboyant . yes , they speak with german accents . but that is yesterday's news . give us something new , something fresh , something funny . putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach . i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the ""star power"" that these guys have . that's fine by me . but please do not dwell on something everybody already knows by heart . hopefully , the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over . in general , the show is definitely a must-see-tv . funny , witty , with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there have not been a comedy this good since seinfeld . i am certainly looking forward to the next episode .",1,10
"thhe2 is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say ""oh sh*t ! "" and ""get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb**s"" or things along those lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing- i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combat . yes there was more violence , gore , and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is ( and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast ) . my time would have been better spent watching aja's remake for the 5th time . so go for some laughs , or go for some gore , but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied .",0,4
"this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac ( olivia dunne ) was very much in love with joe macleod , ( zack ) . the mother is played by mitzi kapture , ( jill dunne ) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface . jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often . there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs . in many ways , olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancuso , ( richard grant ) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner . this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror . enjoy",1,10
surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas . he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer . i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past ( though i did like daredevil and paycheck ) but here he is well cast in this role . i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who cannot stand affleck's character at first . sure you can see where this movie is going but you do not care . ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .,1,7

"having just seen this on tmc , it is fresh in my mind . it's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars , they do not really run the show . first , they are broken into 2 groups - moe , as ""shorty"" and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants , so there is not a whole lot of full team work . the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting , the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability , there is another group of musical stooges that are unfunny , unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish . the music is tiresome , they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses , the dorky western wear is silly , and there is an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera . by the way , this is obviously after curley's first stroke , and his reduced energy level is clear . vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role . i loved everything these guys ever did , including all the non-curley stuff , but this little dogie is pretty lousy .",0,3

what a disappointment ! i hated the mummy but this one was even worse ! it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time . i cannot believe that people actually liked this movie . the role of nicholas cage was not very convincing . the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings . the never stopping flow of hints and combinations was not very convincing either . i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes . what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment . what a drag . . . i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure .,0,1
"for people interested in business and the corporate world , this show is simply the best of the best . as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show : people in business finally had an audience . the whole idea is perfect; having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business-related tasks , set in the best place in the world , new york city . donald trump is perfect as the boss , even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity . he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire , which is one of the negatives about the show . season 1 : great season overall , the best season of the ""normal"" ones . this season was the one that was most about actual business skills . later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements . great and interesting contestants overall , with the most likable character ever in this series : troy . i know i'm not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower-episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task . season 2 : also a great season . the tasks were still pretty much ok , and it had many interesting contestants . jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final , imo . also , this season had the worst firing ever ( pamela ) . season 3 : terrible . actually , i liked the concept of book smarts vs . street smarts , but the cast was so utterly terrible ( it turned out that trump hated the cast as well ) that the whole season was a total disaster . best moments was the second episode ( motel renovation ) , with pm brian fired , a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value . season 4 : an excellent season , much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season ( especially randall , alla , marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral ) . the ""take me out to the boardroom"" episode is one of the absolute classics of this show , ending with the well-remembered quadruple firing . sadly , i think we got robbed for the randall vs . alla final . i think trump was afraid that she could have won , and prevented that from happening . season 5 : a boring season with really no special things to it . brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama . the tasks were terrible overall ( how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all ? ) . i guess the best man won , but personally i could not care less . season 6 : i can see why they wanted to try out l . a . as a new location for the show , but looking back it was a mistake . new york will always be the place for this . this season added so many new things , most of them terrible ( like losing team having to sleep outside in tents , winning pm continues to be pm , for example ) . the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner . james deserved it , no doubt . season 7 : celebrity edition . best season ever . totally different rules ( like the use of rolodexes ) , but all fun and entertainment . the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all , especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa , who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in . this looked to be gene simmon's season , but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task , another man emerged from the shadows : piers morgan . never has anyone dominated a season like he did . he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor ( although some uptight americans ( not all americans , of course , do not take me wrong ) sadly did not have the social skills to understand it ) . way to go piers ! ! for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss . in fact , the british version is way better , and that says something since the american ( and original ) truly is a great show . one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom , unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version .",1,9
"green street , as it was called in the uk , or hooligans is a bad film . the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england , has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately . my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters . don't get me wrong , i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work , but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role . the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal , however he spends much of the film placid and cheery , only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film . this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans . at no point during the film was i convinced that a ) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b ) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold . the other main character is played by charlie hunnam . charlie looks the part , and is fairly convincing as a thug . unfortunately , being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england , he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock-en-y in marry poppins . details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk , but being from the uk it was a problem i could not ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me . the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast , especially the role of bover . the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played . with a film like this , you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible , unfortunately , the casting failed . imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes ( jack ) from will and grace playing michael corleone's part . you would not be convinced . the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities . i am no football hooligan , but i am a fantatical football fan . i know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be , as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan , who is not a fan of the club in question , is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases . my final , and biggest , problem with this film , is the way it portrays football hooligans . i take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals , hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other . this is complete rubbish . football hooligans are complete scum . they take football , the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise , frighten and intimidate people . they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation . they are not brave or loyal , they are cowardly and evil . if the 'gse' in this film truly loved their club , west ham , why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name . hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society . football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans . although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence . it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport . it does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd . it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows . it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone . if you want to see a good film about football violence , watch the bbc drama 'the firm' .",0,4

"val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific . i have seen kilmer on the doors , however his interpretation of john holmes is superb . nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow . wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around . at the same time , the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed . the movie deserves being watched more than once . the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing .",1,9
"the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil . the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction . two brothers , andy and hank , will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most . andy hanson ( philip seymour hoffman ) and his younger brother hank ( ethan hawke ) could not be more different . andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina ( marisa tomei ) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed . hank , however , is divorc e who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife , his daughter's expensive school bills , and endless amount of child support payments . a man who means well and has good intentions , hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it . however , andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better . he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears . the pressure of his life , and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up , have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again . of course , like hank , he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it . how ? by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run . this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers , their families , and several other lives , will be destroyed because of greed , pride , and fear . the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told . after the robbery goes wrong , and nanette hanson ( rosemary harris ) who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed , the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt . we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles ( albert finney ) to the death of his wife . the relationship between charles and his two sons , especially to andy , is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men . nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story . philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also , in contradictory way , as a man we can sympathize with . ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left . andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions . before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face . more than that , our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected . in what should have been best picture of the year , we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives . in other words , there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse . 10/10",1,10

( of course , the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction . ) this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clich s , like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music . michael keaton has never been funnier .",1,7

"gbs wrote his own screen adaptation of this nobel prize winning play but did not live to see it produced ( he had won an oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play pygmalion ) . when otto preminger mounted ( produced and directed ) this production in 1957 , seven years after shaw's death , he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice . taking a cue from shaw's own screenplay , greene uses material from the stage epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play ( one early and one late in joan's story ) into a unified and most satisfying whole . where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission , here it works just as well with a return to king charles balois's bedchamber ( where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation ) , and more material from shaw's epilogue - the introduction of the shade of john gielgud's warwick ( the english ""king maker"" ) . the majority of the language is solid gbs , and the performances from stalwart shauvians ( like felix aymler's inquisitor or harry andrews' de stogumber ) to relative newcomers ( the film established jean seberg's career ) are first rate . it may jar some , only familiar with richard widmark's many movie villains , to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly dauphin , but the performance - oddly top billed - is professional , even if arguably miscast . the symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well . go in expecting quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed .",1,9

"there are two movie experiences i will always cherish . the first was seeing ""star wars"" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother . a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend , trevor , in late october 1978 . halloween left me breathless , speechless , and downright scared . everyone knows the story . young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963 . he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again . he spots laurie ( jamie lee curtis ) , a shy senior who enjoys babysitting , and begins stalking her . her partying friends across the street are killed , one-by-one as michael sets his plot to get her . ironically , the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the ""boogeman , "" and can see him outside . during the murder spree , dr . sam loomis ( donald pleasance ) works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury . he has no proof , no evidence , just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket ( charles cyphers ) . as the plot unfolds , you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare . alfred hitchcock once said , ""you can have four men at a table playing cards and they do not know there is a bomb and it goes off . that is a cheap thrill . however , put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it does not go off , then you have suspense . "" director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween . the audience will see glimpses of him outside , watching , stalking his victims . we gasp . will he kill her ? when will he kill her ? then , michael disappears . carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore . this movie has little blood , but still provides good scares . one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground . he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight , then he drives it . all you hear is a loud thud , then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly . carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer . this also peaks our audience . what will he do ? what's going on inside his mind ? finally , carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension . moreover , the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about . the teens are not ""party mad , "" but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland . finally , there is some decent acting in this ""b , "" low-budget thriller . nick castle who plays ""the shape"" ( michael ) adds something to the mindless killer . it is cold , merciless , and without any pathology . moreover , the personality does everything the same way . he kills only when trapped , or to set up a trap . he splits the victims apart . he also relies on brute strength . and that mask used ( a bleached william shatner mask ) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion . while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues , he comes across as someone scared , desperate , and determined . it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil . the crown jewel , though , is jamie lee curtis' debut . she plays the laurie character as someone scared , but also determined and strong who fights back . the end is one that left me speechless . this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped . movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times . halloween , and other scary movies , though , do not have that advantage . so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new , halloween would be the movie i would choose .",1,10
"anyone who has said that it is better than hostel is talking complete crap , believe me i'm not a fan of hostel but this is just ridiculous . this is just another shot on camcorder , straight to dvd , low on ideas waste of your time , i cannot believe how many of these films there are and i'm yet to see a decent one . in the 80's video nasties , gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say . now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in blockbuster to rent a copy , until people stop doing this then i guess these films will keep appearing . this film is so low on ideas it is just amazing how it ever got made , the acting is also terrible , the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief . this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it , unless you are on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time . my best/worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they do not back off , you can see that she is not even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip . an absolute joke .",0,1
"there are many good things about the new bsg : there's the multiple cylon roles for model 8 and 6 , for example , which the two actresses played superbly . there's the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica ( ""my ship will not be networked , over my dead body ! "" ) also , all the space battles , the special effects ( even though the seasoned sci-fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all ) the darkness of the characters , their essentially flawed nature . that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish . yes , the first part , the scenes in space , the raid on the cylons and all that was very good . but the mushy ending ? i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden , so i never know how much time is left until the end . so for me it was a special kind of torture , to see the end happen over and over again . every time i thought , oh this is the final scene , the final shot , i got one more . every frakking character got its complete ending ! that was not really necessary . what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all : the young roslin scenes . why is important for us to know that : {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has a one night stand with a former pupil/student ? what does that bring to the story ? where was the linkage ? now , i'm all for a more european-ish style approach , and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows , and all that , but this was just ridiculous . this did not bring anything meaningful to the story . also , i've seen the ""last frakkin special"" and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot : he could not come up with a good ending for the story , so . . . . he just did not ! it's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be . the whole ""this was thousands of years in the past"" idea , the mitochondrial eve thing , was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy , and believe you me , there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h2g2 storyline . and speaking of hera , now there is a storyline that was not worked out well , at all . instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who is 20 years younger . don't get me wrong , i'm all for older women with younger men . the more power to them . but this . . . just made no sense . all in all , ( the writing in ) this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be . that goes even moreso for the last episode . i hope lost and 24 do better , with their series finales .",0,3
"this is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of lincoln ( born 1809 hodgensville-kentucky- and died in washington 1865 ) . ford's excellent movie takes abraham lincoln ( fonda ) from his youth . he studied laws , common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837 . this hollywood biography follows lincoln from his log-cabin days , initial relationship to mary todd ( weaver ) , following the couple from their first ball , and his departure for congress candidate . but focuses mainly on a brothers ( richard cromwell , eddie quillan ) accused for murder , the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum ( alice brady ) . the lincoln-fonda as defender advocate and donald meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant . excellent performance from henry fonda as idealistic , traveller springfield solicitor , he was to star regularly for ford from this movie , as grapes of wrath , my darling clementine , and fort apache . besides sterling acting by alice brady as grieved mother , she was a great actress from the silent cinema , but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer . the lincoln's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining . his portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness , uprightness and willful . lincoln , like john ford , was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth . this american masterpiece is correct on both counts , as splendid biography and as magnificent drama . another biographies about abraham lincoln are the following : 1 ) abraham lincoln ( 1930 ) by d . w . griffith with walter huston , una merkel , talking from his birth until his assassination; 2 ) abe lincoln in illinois ( 1940 ) by john cromwell with raymond massey , ruth gordon , concerning similar events to ford's film through his career as lawyer 3 ) tv version titled gore vidal's lincoln with sam waterston and mary tyler moore as mary todd .",1,7

"filmed just after the war , this story was made in order to highlight anglo-american relations after the war . it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwii . remarkably the film tangles together the royal air force , sigmund freud psychology , the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs ( special effects in its infancy ) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity . although sounding absurd , this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since . be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet , innocent and charming love story . roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show ! ! ! ! british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years .",1,10
"there is a certain genius behind this movie . i was laughing throughout . the scene in the phone sex office , discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor . execution is poor , but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent . the doppelganger split at the end was like . . . ""ok , was not quite expecting that but let us see what the movie has to say"" . certainly ridiculous , but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way . is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ? i am easily bored by many movies , but this one kept my interest throughout . i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots , but that is just a guess . horribly bad , but good . i'm looking for other movies this person may have done ( with more experience ) .",1,8
"i do not think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it is over if you were ever scared . this does not really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film does not tack on one of those happy endings . story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto , japan so that ted fletcher ( edward albert ) can write a book and he brings along his wife laura ( susan george ) and their daughter amy ( amy barrett ) . their friend alex curtis ( doug mcclure ) who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . about 140 years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher's arrive it does not take long before strange things start happening . *****spoiler alert***** at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher's and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair . meanwhile , ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help . unfortunately the ghosts get ted , laura , and alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier . this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them . while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked . first , it does not have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . instead , it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . secondly , it has susan george in the cast ! i've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does not have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it is one of the reasons why she was so popular . but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . this is not a bad film but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .",0,4
"'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic britain , rather like 'bend it like beckham' , or more closely , 'east is east' , with which it shares a 1970s setting . the tone is resolutely chirpy ( in spite of the dour black country accents ) , but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite . moreover , the portrayal of the film's central relationship , between an asian girl and her white friend , is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it . i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer , this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced , but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story . 'east is east' was fun and sharp; 'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison .",0,4
"clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter , tho he finds her , the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim . whilst here , the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollinger's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer . as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit , they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of it is unsavoury elements . man with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one , at the time of me writing this , it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it . it's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western , this is a fine entry in the western genre . that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel , probably has not done the film any favours over the years , i myself read the synopsis and thought it is just another in the line of similarly themed pictures . yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments , both technically and as a functioning story . robert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger , perfectly cast , he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace . we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had {justifiably of course} , mitchum is right up there with the best of them . one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place , we do not see his face , but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us ! . the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchum's shadow , so really it is solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high , perhaps it is unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick , but man with the gun's minor failings are with its villains , and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace . the score from alex north is excellently layered {fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up} and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot . directed and co-written by first time director richard wilson , man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre , but it is dark in tone , violent and above all else , highly watchable . 7 . 5/10",1,7
"redline is a knockoff of fast & furious , without any of the redeeming qualities . it does not need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises , but it needs something ! this is the equivalent of a porn film , where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end . except that this is worse , because you do not get your money's worth . mind-numbingly boring , impossible race sequences , and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars , which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie . sure , she is hot , but who is that desperate for an on screen female ? i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets , and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes . no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes .",0,1
"the year 1934 was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself . unfortunately , the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here . two of those things were singing and dancing . another was a short , interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off the depression . you know the other keys to shirley's successful films . this film achieved none of the above , despite the star presences of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry hathaway . in addition , there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring , and too many arguments between a sullen lombard and cooper . to top it off , you did not get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants . i guess they learned after this movie .",0,3
"no , just kidding . it was god-awful . i was watching my local sci-fi station last night , which plays movies , every night , within a monthly theme . this month it is ""space turkeys , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs"" . movies so bad , they should never have been made . this was a good selection . everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions , the gore make-up ( which showed potential ) and the editing ( which slightly out did the rest of the movie , in terms of being horrible ) . the acting is horrible all around , the dialog is horrible , the script , the direction . it's not a good movie . it consists of two forms of special effects , gore and stock footage of space . i'll focus on the gore . watching this movie , i thought to myself , ""what was the motivation behind the making of this movie ? "" people like making stuff , sure , but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved . i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make-up effects guy's demo reel . he ( rick baker ) actually went on to a pretty nice career , he is worked on star wars ( 1977 ) , king kong ( 1976 ) , men in black ( 1996 ) , and even the incredible shrinking woman ( 1981 ) , plus a number of other notable flicks . other than that , i cannot say i've ever actually seen a real , live melting man - incredible , or otherwise - but i'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one . now , when i think of bad editing , i usually think of maybe a scene where someone's talking on the phone and then , in the middle of the scene , the phone jumps down to his shoulder , or something to that effect . this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms . specifically , over-long and utterly useless scenes . just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have , from a little bit of dead air to that crazy-long screaming scene with cleaver girl . and that severed head in the river , the head gets thrown into a river ( in slow motion ) , the movie carries on for a couple minutes , and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall . while i'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head , what the hell ? ? lastly , i'll mention the running fat lady/slow motion scene right near the beginning . the jerky slow motion tells me that they did not shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it ""was not working like that"" and then slowed it down . oy vey . in any event , if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed , glass door - all in slow motion , mind you - remember the incredible melting man , for *this* is where it all started . movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends . this one's a little slow most of the time but that is just all the more time to come up with your own one-liners . it's not the worst of the worst but it is pretty freaking bad .",0,1
"you get a gift . it is exquisitely wrapped . the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail . that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper , handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists . the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace . it is a sight to behold . then you cut the ribbon , rip off the paper , open up the box , and find . . . nothing . that's toys . you either enjoy the packaging , or forget about it . the film is not without its point and purpose : war is a not a good thing . well , is not that original ! the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out . and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing , until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys . it's like someone preaching a stern , condescending sermon , only to end by saying ""just kidding . "" but even as an empty box , the film fails close scrutiny . yes , it is a sight to behold with some remarkable , striking images . the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill . but the images are cold and emotionally sterile . like the screenplay , the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal . it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things , yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold . the film strives to be funny , in a morose sort of way , but the humor is forced and artificial . robin williams , as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire , tosses in his ad-lib shtick , which only seems alien to the bizarre , coldly structured world he is inhabiting . indeed , the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be . for this film to work , or make sense , it needs to be set in its own universe , an oz far removed from kansas . every time the jokes jerk us back into reality , the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham . it is said that this was director barry levinson's pet project , one that he had been striving to get made for ten years . it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing . like most pet projects that finally get made ( radioland murders , radio flyer & battlefield : earth being great examples ) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision . perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage . he had already perfected it to death . many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy , mechanical , wind-up monstrosities . so is the film itself .",0,1
"just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time , picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it , i've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well . avoid of all the hollywood glamour , special effects and stress on the ""shock factor"" , this independent film by paul f . ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations . taking place after a high school shooting , two characters alicia ( busy philipps ) and deanna ( erika christensen ) form an unlikely bond . alicia , the girl with the stone heart , the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath . meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again . not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting , but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart . despite its low-budget and short filming time , this movie is far from cheesy . ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche . with an amazing up and coming actress , philipps , adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the ""doom and gloom"" feeling this movie may have . overall , i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it , i also suggest the documentary ""it's a girls world"" put out by cbc in 2004 , which deals with the topic of social bullying , comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal , quebec and the other in victoria , british columbia , the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied .",1,9

"i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film . the story is simple . an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children . the faces of the actors are marvelous to see . the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well . the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine , which was more sophisticated and intricate . the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel . the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism , humanity , and history portrayed .",1,8

"if there is one film which is the worst of this year- it is tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film , and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock , it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif's introduction which is boring then saif- kareena meet , kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god , what he is doing in such a weird film ? what kinda role it is ? what acting is he doing ? his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes , but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance , overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke vijay krishna acharya would have got 3 films more to direct , if this film had worked , thats the strategy of yashraj , only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music ( vishal shekhar ) is ordinary performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air , he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating , kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay",0,1
"this movie will not sit well with some , but it is a must view . i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as ""other"" african americans moved in . ( minor spoilers ) this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint . . . you have an african american male ( danny glover ) who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970's . like any american , he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot , there was still alot of problems going on . the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids . one owning a home ? wow . then the blending in began . his wife ( whoopi goldberg ) is told to ""get involved"" so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do . and just when the man thinks he and his family are ""in"" , right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the ""lotto"" ( mo'nique ) , and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he does not want the neighborhood to think they are alike . he , of course is of a better calibre , his new neighbor is ""ghetto"" not an should not be there ! who's got a problem now ? what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in , and how they lose themselves in the process . it makes you question where does racism begin and end . . . and with whom . it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have , you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you . it also shows how these african american children , when ""blending in"" neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture ( complete with blonde hair and blue eyes , mind you ! ) around them . they laugh along with the jokes , not knowing they are the joke and not knowing . . why . but overall , this film is about 'people' . no matter what race you are , this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other . . . all for the sake of fitting in . . all because you feel you have more money than others , so that automatically makes you better -- and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you . again , not for everyone . but take a look and judge for yourself .",1,10
"david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication - the troubled talent . and it is a role he plays well . this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end . timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts . the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted . drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail . unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene . but , that aside , a movie worth seeing .",1,7
"""a family affair"" takes us back to a less complicated time in america . it's sobering to see how different everything was back then . it was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a 'functional' family dealing in things together . the film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the hardy family . the film , directed by george seitz , is based on a successful play . judge james hardy , and his wife emmily , are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with . married daughter joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible . at the same time , another daughter , marion , brings home a beau , who is clear will clash with her father . the happy teen ager andy , seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort polly to the dance , something he is reluctant to do . needless to say , judge hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again . after all , he is a man that understands , not only the law , but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy . lionel barrymore plays judge hardy with conviction . he is the glue that holds everything together . spring byington is seen as emily , the mother . mickey rooney has a small part in this film , but he is as always , fun to watch . cecilia parker and julie haydon appeared as the daughters , marion and joan . sara hayden and margaret marquis are also featured in the film as aunt milly and polly , the girl that surprises andy with her beauty . ""a family affair"" is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an american family .",1,7
"i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature . i love all of jason steele's comedy . it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable . i love indie films and this one is just great . the plot is strange but very funny . this short film is about a talking spatula named edward . the order of the events are a bit jumbled , making this film very interesting to watch . at first you see edward fighting the spoons , but then the focus changes to earlier in his life . this is a silly movie , but of course , it is still great . i highly recommend that you watch this film at www . spatulamadness . com or www . filmcow . com . it's very funny . the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway . it'll only take 16 minutes of your time , and it is free . go watch spatula madness !",1,10
"this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england . filmed on location in bolton , it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home . or so it seems . cleverly , the film , based on the play , portrays the complexities of family life . the supporting cast is terrific as well , with many familiar faces lending support .",1,9
"this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur , and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river . this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along . it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder . he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge . stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back . as the movie goes along it is like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur . it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska . this is one of stewart's better westerns .",1,7
"another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre . successful , and not , in varying degrees . buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary ( and very active ) demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment . while not at the forefront , buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie , much like kurosawa's ""ran"" . it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it is nowheres near ""ran's"" league . stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length . the lead actors are uniformly excellent . the music is really good . the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes . the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing . and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups . this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat . another recent film like this is tsui hark's ""seven swords"" , great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing . asano really does not move like a sword wielding demon , his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene . good movie , you will probably find it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fights .",1,7

"sadly , marry harron decided to do a fictional account of bettie page's life to go along with her own issues with men . as typical in all her work , every major male character is portrayed as weak , bumbling , or twisted . to add to her fiction , she projects ideas and issues that are not true , according to bettie page herself . bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues ( though she became a born-again later in life , through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister ) . she left it , because she was in her late 30's , her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks . the hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what bettie did must have been victimized by men . harron fails to point out that bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots ( not handed to her by ""sick"" fetishists ) . harron also fails to make a point that bunny yeager , who did many famous photo shoots of bettie , also did many ""naughty"" shoots with bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film . the only saving grace is gretchen mol looks very much like bettie . otherwise , there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it .",0,3
"i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies , especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side , and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie , but there are parts that are very serious , and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi-function actor . as for the rest of the cast , i was happy with jennifer aniston's acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell , his limited scenes are very funny , especially in the anchor scene . overall , i would have to rate this a 9 . good acting , funny script , and some very serious situations make this a very good film .",1,9
"jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season ( late may ) and a good improvement on carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies . with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self , carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic , tearfully somber moments . elements of jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie . this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons , including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script . while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama , bruce , almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste . eight out of ten stars .",1,8
"first of all , i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books , a wrinkle in time . this movie , however , ruined that excitement for me . i am sorry , but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool . in the movie , she has straight hair and no glasses and is the ""sporty type"" with a deep voice . this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all . in fact , meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young . this is just one major example how the book and movie are different . so i would say , if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes , watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series , i would suggest skipping this movie .",0,4
"you have to understand , when wargames was released in 1983 , it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers . the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions , let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling . real computers were beginning to show up in people's homes , and for the first time , society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie's premise excitingly prescient . granted , a talking computer that balanced it is free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched , but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it . i've probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on . fast forward 25 years , and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a ""sequel"" , called wargames : the dead code . i'll just dig right in . first of all , the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects . you're probably very confused right now . the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub-game within the web site called ""the dead code"" where they pilot a plane over a city , spraying it with bioweapons . at some point in the game , you have to choose between ""sarin gas"" and ""anthrax"" , and if you choose ""sarin"" , then you are automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated . in the movie , this actually happens . however , since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious , it obviously all makes sense . second , the avatar of the ai in this straight-to-dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop-up-ad-esquire sound bite ""play with me baby"" . because apparently in the future , advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess , and gets into porn . third , the motivation for these ""hackers"" is profit and women , as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie . for some reason , recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else . that may work for your average sitcom , but c'mon , you do not learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair , playing sports , and shopping at the mall , folks . the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie , and then later there is the phrase , ""good hunting , will"" . i swear , they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr . damon . this will kid is not bad , but he was certainly was not like any obsessive hacker i've ever met . i cannot fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original , because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except professor falken and joshua ( wopr ) make a reappearance in this movie , as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom , and a dilapidated old tic-tac-toe machine with a higher pitched voice . after some prodding , joshua ( the ai ) has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice , a bunch of board games flash on the big screens , and the whole ""the only way to win , is not to play"" revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment . except that those of us who saw the original , you know , those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that . a recycled ending for a movie made from last month's compost . the new movie was directed by a guy who is done 90210 , and written by guys who do b movies . the original was directed by a guy who is been keeping himself busy with ""heroes"" , so you see the quality difference there . there was talk of a real remake , but i hope they do not destroy this classic all over again . i swear , if i have to , i'll visit every gambling web site until i find the one that is run by a psychotic government computer . the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix , so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing , clicking , and indigestion .",0,4
"there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense . some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--do not make it to the screen at all , and those who do are watered down to the point that there is no reason for their existence . where's the relationship between christophe and marcel ? where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet ? why does dolly rose appear at all , since her story's never explained ? where's the rape and redemption of marie , whose greatest attribute ( and downfall ) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to richard ? why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father ? we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred ? as for the performances , there is not a one that is better than mediocre , though that is likely due to the lousy script . best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard--but richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film . worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose , though again , it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she is given to work with . all in all , this is just terrible . i thought it would be impossible for any anne rice book-turned film to be worse than exit to eden , but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit . how is it that rice is such a slut she will allow her best works to become such junk on the screen ?",0,2
"by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece ""vertigo"" , they also made this light comedy . perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film . at any rate this a great companion piece to ""vertigo"" as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance . in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of ""vertigo"" with it is happy ending . here again novak undergoes a transformation , in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal . stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her . unlike vertigo the two come together in ""bell book and candle"" , a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie . again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein . the cast is terrific . lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt . ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great . the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it is best . anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you have not should see this memorable light comedy .",1,8
"yes , the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature , stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews ( with a strange accent , no less ) chasing an ostrich , tons of stock footage of wildlife , and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard , and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .",0,4

"i have to be 100% honest with you fellow imdb users . i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster . doesn't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way ? i'm in love with that woman ! i got what i expected . . . but only half . this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations . while i do not agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated; i must admit that ""pr te-moi ta main"" has plenty of flaws . my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters . there is not a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment ""of romance"" or even a clue to suggest that they are interested in each other . in fact , the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward ( when both are in the couch ) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest . i did not buy the dinner sequence . still , the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise . i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days . i understand it is a movie and that is why i accept it as a funny situation . plus , the humor is versatile . there are moments involving s&m , funny lines with chabat's best friend , some lesbian references , funny situations involving the family women , and more . charlotte gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she is by far the reason to watch the movie . she is funny , sexy , looks very thin and fine , and demonstrates she is a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance . alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance . i think the supporting cast do what they can . the score , art direction , and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film . those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits . it's a good example of feel good cinema .",1,7
"""magnolia"" is a preposterous , bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little . like ""eyes wide shut , "" ""magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence . the camera swoops through hallways and corridors , catching glimpses of sad characters . where is the reason to care for these people ? the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot , who cannot care for others ( except for john c . reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters ) , and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying . i was reminded of how much i disliked ""shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller-stahl . there are so many unattractive , unappealing characters here , why would we want to spend time with them ? having said that , there is nothing held back about ""magnolia . "" paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon . there are two ideas in particular that bomb . both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film . one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs . sweet , but ineffectual since we cannot see what strings them all together . the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous . ""magnolia"" has a lot of great acting . particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i did not know he had in him . and john c . reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory . but it all adds up to nothing . when the secret unexpected event happened , a girl behind me in the theatre could not hold it in any more and said , ""this is stupid !

"diana guzman is an angry young woman . surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas , she takes her anger out on the closest targets . when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club , she knows she is found her home . the film progresses from there , as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing . michelle rodriguez is very good in the role , particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism . the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors , who pale in comparison to the older , more experienced cast . there are too many pauses in the script , which detracts from the dramatic tension . the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity . this is a good picture to see once , if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power . its limitations prevent it from being placed in the ""see it again and again"" category .",0,3

"what starts out as a gentle country yarn , inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister , as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western . an amiable rancher ( norton ) wanders into town and charms a young girl ( evan rachel wood ) , seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance , but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye . edward norton a real chameleon actor ( with changing facial hair to match ) playing a country hick , accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he is merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent . he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan . however , with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from , and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused . evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton . down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace , and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain . should we like this drifter or not ? even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear . this ambiguity is to the film's detriment , as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch . had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film , but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess . fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone . completist fans of norton aside ( or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley ) , give this a miss .",0,4
"-a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in , or else have her father die . see now that is what you happens when you fly coach , stuff like that never happens in first class . -other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight , the other thing that this movie shares with ""flightplan"" is the sheer unbelievability *if that is a word* of the story . the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan , but will not it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel's system ? teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers , so i'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie . -plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . but i'm 100% sure that i'm reading way too much into it . the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of ""24"" so one cannot be perplexed by such complexities . for all my complaints though , this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . it's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain , but at the same time it does not require great intelligence to fully enjoy . -i'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i cannot . i love rachel mcadams , i love cillian murphy , and i like brian cox , but they do not really stretch their acting muscles here . it's not really much of a problem since this is not the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting is not the least bit horrible , just not great . wes craven is not exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this , but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing ""cursed"" and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie , i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it is release . -one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was . it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while , but nowadays it is like every movie that comes out feels too long , where as this movie just felt like the right length . not too long , and too short . they do not waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this is not the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . being a huge film music geek , i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami . it's really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he is doing now . i really the cool techno/orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . too bad that i cannot find the soundtrack anywhere , would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it . -overall it's nice for what it is and whiles it is far from great cinema , should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half",1,7
"this movie ( not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder ) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history . beware : the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction . the film is not an exploration of anything , and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own warts . the script is pointless and meandering , with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes . however , even the sex scenes are lame lame lame . except for the first , they are around three seconds long ( then again , maybe my version was cut ) and comically overwrought . if you are looking for a decent film , you do not want this . if you are looking for a titillating sex-flick , you do not want this . whatever your life's goals , desires , or perspectives , you do not want to watch this movie . how they got rosanna arquette , natashia kinski , and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme .",0,1

"i will not try to speculate as to what brando was attempting . at his best he turns in such oddball performances , insinuating so many things at once , that it does not seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct . often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others , a concentration which , if followed , turns out something of a red herring , as he turns out subtler , craftier than at first appeared . this is a mastery of artifice , not naturalism , as might be associated with the method . the role of sky masterson , as mankiewicz so wonderfully realized , seems tailored for him , which is to begin with odd , and odd still at the end , because whatever it is brando has done , he has managed a grace maybe all his own , but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again , odd , coming from an actor with limited musical ability , not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy . jean simmons , also oddly cast , is not quite as impressive , but certainly above just-adequate , really delightful in the havana sequence , and never less than enjoyable throughout . and yet . . . perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing , and characters on what it is they intend of each other , there does not seem to be the lovers' ""chemistry"" brought up so insistently more than once . brando/sky masterson and simmons/sister sarah respectively feed off one another well enough , but i for one do not see more beyond that . in a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining ( and most everything about it , craft-wise , is just that -- dazzling ) , that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked , but so much would depend upon true chemistry ! an , at least partial , transformation of the characters through such chemistry , would lend something positively moving to the final scene . as it is , one leaves this film certainly delighted , but not really moved , except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union . note sister sarah marries in her missionary's uniform , sky masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux . and they have changed back to those from their previous scene ! funnily enough ( that is , insightfully ) , the most touching , and most serious , scene is , i think , between brando and vivian blaine , as sinatra/nathan detroit is doll , adelaide , the only scene where these two are exclusively together , not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in adelaide's dressing-room while adelaide is about to change . though one may submit there is no place for that , sky really is the type to ""check out"" adelaide in this sort of circumstance . he is even there to tell adelaide nathan will not be meeting her to elope . adelaide and sky are both true in their respective ways to nathan , even piteous of him , as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange . adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed , but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for nathan , as sky is admonishing her that she cannot love a man and then wish him to be someone else . guys and dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes , around the themes of gambling and salvation . since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair , there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind brando's and simmons' lack of chemistry . after all , that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation ( echoed by the sinatra/blaine pairing , though with considerably less self-deception involved ) , which might explain brando's and simmons' odd , rather provoking , interpretations of sky masterson and sister sarah . i realize simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism , but brando , though playing to confront her , is not exactly heated and eager , and is more than keeping his distance -- he is also assimilating it , keeping his balance through it . his boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to cuba , a kiss , whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf . this may be shrewd , as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary , and through . but it makes sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting sarah brown a little less than persuasive . yet why does he want her ? what does falling in love mean to sky ? i find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in , and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward sister sarah , so he does , as he is promised her , need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting , make good by his ""marker , "" as he puts it , as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her . but this still denotes self-concern more than anything . however , it also allows for sarah brown's own self-concern , as sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover . neither , at least it seems , will change much by their union , except perhaps in the acceptance of the other . yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition : acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other , let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by ""chemistry . "" and behind all this , i suspect is mankiewicz's full knowing . for all those who might say , in defense of guys and dolls yet , that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth , i need only remind them cabaret , the three-penny opera , carousel , a star is born , even the sound of music , which i do not care for as much ( and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-cabaret musicals ) , all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties .",1,10

"baby face is one of the better of the ""forgotten"" films before the code . it was shown last night after the 1931 version of waterloo bridge on the turner classic network , so i was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored . stanwyck is living in east st . louis ( where she may have known the drunken parents of ""myra"" - mae clarke - in waterloo bridge ) . her father is robert barrett . she has lived with him since the death of her mother , and ( in the restored dialog ) he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old . now she is resident waitress and part-time whore in his speakeasy , her closest friend being chico ( theresa harris ) , the african-american servant who barrett keeps bullying . it is one of the two good points of stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about harris , threatening to leave if harris is fired ( and since it is the grubby workers like nat pendleton , who enjoy seeing stanwyck serve them , rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in , barrett has to obey her ) . the one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual adolf cragg ( alphonse ethier ) , who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home . he is also pushing the philosophy of friedrich nietzche , and the idea of the will to power . more about this later . after she knocks out the local political bigwig ( arthur hohl ) , and has an argument with barrett about this , a still explosion kills barrett , and enables stanwyck to leave her home town . she and harris head to new york city , managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman ( james murray ) . they reach new york , and after walking about they see the gotham trust company ( established 1873 ) , and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is . we slowly watch stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top , similar ( but sleazier ) than robert morse dared in how to succeed in business without really trying . but morse was a man in a man dominated company . stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon . she goes through john wayne , douglas dumbrille ( a section of the film that i always felt was the most shocking - curiously enough - when i watched it ) , douglas wood , henry kolker , and finally george brent . each ends up falling for her , and either being pushed aside when no longer useful , or destroyed by her . brent , the new president of the bank his grandfather founded , eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken ( especially after brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds ) . brent is indicted . will she stick up for him ? spoiler coming up : the one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings . the original ending had stanwyck boarding a ship for europe abandoning brent to his fate , but realizing she cannot do it to him , returning to their apartment house , and finding he is shot himself . she is riding with him to the hospital as it ends . now before the rediscovered footage was found , the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it , and retiring back to east st . louis , to live happily if poor . neither of these are good endings . stanwyck should continue on her destructive course , with brent the last of her victims . but even without the breen office the script writers ( one is darryl zanuck , by the way ) saw fit to have her find a moral center . she has none - at least none for powerful men ( whom she hates ) . i do not think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion . there are other problems , due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society . it was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933 , so stanwyck has her work cut out for her . wood ( when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him ) admits that he did not want her to work . but in 2006 , stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place . in the film there are nasty , catty remarks ( obviously some based on jealousy ) towards stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise . in 2006 , she would be frequently confronting women superiors , and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly . of course , if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful . and she also never seems to meet any men who are gay . they do have gay male executives in business , who would not give a damn about her legs or breasts . then there is her mentor , mr cragg . cragg is remade in the ""bowdlerized"" version into trying to make her seek a moral center . in reality he pushes nieztsche , but the way ( in a broader sense ) the nazis pushed nieztsche - find your way to power and push it . while nieztsche did stress power sometimes , it was not the be-all and end-all of his theories . otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses . cragg is obviously self-educated , but only half-educated . in short if somebody who thoroughly studied nieztsche confronted cragg he would make him look like a half-educated fool . and this is stanwyck's mentor ! a good film , and for it is day worth a 10 . . . but seriously flawed .",1,10

"just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it . here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered ( certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully ) by george romero . but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it is a comedy ! and , yes , i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead' . thoroughly believable and , perhaps even more importantly , enjoyable performances by dylan baker , carrie-anne moss and young actor k'sun ray , whom i suspect we will be seeing a lot more of in future features . however , i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr . theopolis , essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride ( or , for those who have seen the film , would not that read even better here as the corpse pride ? ) and , of course , scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated , yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character . just think , he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare's commitments to prison break ( as was revealed in the q&a following thursday night's screening ) . i cannot help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead's zombie 'bub' . i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i will not start now . suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour , graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero . rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and , although ( and i did have to think back carefully to be sure ) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence , the delectable humour , so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co-screenwriters , goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg-13 . i urge you to go see this little canuck gem . i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer .",1,9

"those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson's alter-ego elvira , then this is a good place to start . ""elvira , mistress of the dark"" starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message . it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will . anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas , she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money . unfortunately , the place she has to go is the town of fallwell , massachusetts . having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down , she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things : a house , a dog and a cookbook . the town residents have mixed reactions : the teens like her , the women hate her , and the men lust after her ( although trying to remain moral pillars of the community ) . her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent ( w . morgan sheppard ) , because he wants her cookbook . seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock . the film is actually pretty funny , with peterson a . k . a . elvira using her ""endowments"" and sexiness as a joke ( ""and do not forget , tomorrow we are showing the head with two things . . . i mean the thing with two heads"" ) . especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah , the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line , but ends up looking ridiculous ( the picnic scene is the perfect example ) . deserves a peek ( the film , not her boobs , of course ) .",1,9

"wow . this was probably the worst dcom ever . i watched the first half hour and i laughed . brenda song plays wendy , the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen . she is supposed to save the world as a warrior , and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts . shin teaches her the skills of a snake , tiger , etc . and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world . this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible . brenda song is a comedic actress and i cannot see her playing a serious role . it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin . shin could not act at all , and everything was totally unbelievable . i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar , and the thing i came up with was the power rangers . this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid . the characters were not likable and i just could not stand to watch it . disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies . high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel , along with other movies like jumping ship , color of friendship , go figure , read it and weep , & stuck in the suburbs . if you like action-adventure and corny jokes , you will like this movie .",0,1
"i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie , but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen ! first of all , the pace is incredibly slow , so it seems much longer than it is ( and it is not short ) . i'm sure when jane austen wrote the book , she made it several pages long , filled it with description , and did not intend for people to read in in one day , or it might drag and lose it is appeal , which ""emma"" most certainly did . now ""sense and sensibility"" had this flaw of a slow pace , but at least it had lively lines to make up for it , as well as some good performances ! that brings me to flaw #2 , which is of course , the acting . while i do not happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film , i am sure they are capable of good work , but i did not see much of it in this movie . it was like people were trying too hard to be witty , too hard to be ""upper-class"" , too hard to be british ( well , some of them ) , so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people . #3 . the cast , as i said , seemed only like actors , and not actually like the people they were playing . maybe that is a good thing , because the people they played really were not all that nice . why did everybody like emma , for example ? sure , she was nice to the rich , handsome people in front of them , but she was an awful gossip behind their backs . if her friends were ""ugly"" , then she did not even bother to go behind their backs . so , why is this girl so great ? why do people have to tell stories , ""just to make her laugh ? "" of course the snob could not even do that right . i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow , and her ""emma"" did not exactly change my opinion . well , it is easy to see that i did not care for this one . i'm sure it is a lovely book and all , but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen , and ""emma"" is one of them .",0,2

"as a kid i thought this movie was great . it had animals , it had beautiful music , and it had my favorite actor : michael j . fox . now , i still love this movie , for different reasons . it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera . it has beautiful , well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly , with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme , that still makes me cry . even when people hum it . and it has my favorite actor , michael j . fox . based on a book , this is the story of three house pets , an intelligent , overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow , a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog , chance . the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away . dismayed and worried , the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives . a truly incredible journey . so what , maybe home is just over that mountain . but what if it is not ? i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters , and for anyone else that . . . yeah , everyone go watch it .",1,9
"this is an incredible film . i cannot remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered . it's funny , it is tragic , it is compelling , and most of all it is a slice of swedish small town life . it crushes the clich s , and dwells deeper . it makes you feel connected , not only to the main characters , but to all the characters . big city girl tracing back to her roots , her small hometown , to celebrate her father's 70th birthday , crossing paths with people she has not met in several years . although the story itself is not unique , it offers a fresh approach . the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters ( on different stages in life ) , who are not very close . or at least do not realize how close they are . one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast . first , i'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called 'a-list' swedish actors in this film . usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden . this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession . sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva r se to prove that you do not need words to convey an emotion . the writing is also very appealing . the dialogue is more than believable , and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two , it is ahead by miles . maria blom controls everything from the beginning , and if you did not know , you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film . i cannot wait for her next one . once you start watching this , you really want to see it through .",1,10

"the author of numerous novels , plays , and short stories , w . somerset maugham ( 1874-1965 ) was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime , and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public . published in 1944 , the razor's edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values . it was maugham's last major novel--and it was immensely popular . given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues , it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version--but darryl f . zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication . according to film lore , the razor's edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himself--and it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation . when the film went into production , however , cukor was replaced by edmund goulding , a director less known for artistic touch than a workman-like manner , and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti , the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident . tyrone power , recently returned from military service during world war ii , was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell; gene tierney , one of the great beauties of her era , was cast as socialite isabell bradley . the supporting cast was particularly notable , including herbert marshall , anne baxter , clifton webb , lucille watson , and elsa lanchester . both budget and shooting schedule were lavish , and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike . but time has a way of putting things into perspective . seen today , the razor's edge is indeed a beautifully produced film--but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity . as in most cases , the major problem is the script . although it is reasonably close to maugham's novel in terms of plot , it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story . we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment; we are told that he receives it; we are told he acts on it--but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual , artistic , philosophical , and intellectual processes behind any of it . we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself . it has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees . we are left with the shell of maugham's plot , which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell , a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them . tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent , but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support . unfortunately , that does not happen here; they are extremely one-note and power is greatly miscast to boot . fortunately , the supporting cast is quite good , with herbert marshall , clifton webb , and lucille watson particularly so; the then-famous performance by anne baxter , however , has not worn as well as one would hope . with a running time of just under two and a half hours , the film also feels unnecessarily long . there is seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter , and indeed the entire india sequence ( which reads as faintly hilarious ) would have been better cut entirely--an odd situation , for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film . regardless of the specific scene , it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point . as for the dvd itself , the film has not been remastered , but the print is extremely good , and while the bonus package is not particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor . when all is said and done , i give the razor's edge four stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the material--but frankly , this a film best left power and tierney fans , who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars , and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself . gft , amazon reviewer",0,4
"the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera . deeply character-driven films are great , but only if the characters are compelling . and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel . the villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist . the great lt . columbo himself is no where near his famous , lovable , self-effacing , crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering , one-dimensional damsel-in-distress ( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on ! ! ! i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds ) . in any sense of reality , this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little . and speaking of reality . . . . the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police . the police ? ? give me a break . everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case . this was no columbo , just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt . columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours .",0,2

"this film is not deserved of the next few minutes i will spend criticizing it , but i know many people , like myself , rely on imdb . com to assist in deciding on films . for that reason alone , i am writing this .

as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best . the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont ? pines yes - palms no . and the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees . when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express . did they ship themselves overnight in a crate ? come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur . the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo . the two should have switched roles . the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible . applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time,0,2

"a group of model-caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards . who is the killer and why is the killer after them ? my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up , sometimes slightly down . however , i cannot remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine . the first time i watched it , upon its theatrical release , i thought it was pretty awful--i gave it a 4 out of 10 , the equivalent of an ""f"" letter grade . watching it for a second time last night , i cannot remember what the heck i did not like about it . i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it , or maybe i just did not get it . in any event , i loved it this time , giving it a 9 out of 10 , or an ""a"" . it might sound ridiculous saying i did not get a film like this , but there is something to get . valentine is almost a comedy/horror . director jamie blanks , who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend , takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream ( 1996 ) and pushes most of the elements up a notch , making valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity ( where absurdism is a positive stylistic term ) . on top of that , he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships . the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects . most of the situations in the film , and the modus operandi of the villain , humorous or not , are tied in to the valentine's day theme . many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clich -rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments . however , in light of the above , the film is intentionally clich d , implausible and ludicrous . it's as if blanks is attempting ( and mostly succeeding ) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros . that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day . it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film , and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre , making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning . scream had a similar aim with its horror material , but the twist there was that the film was ""self-aware"" . valentine's day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire . lest some think i'm ""reading too much"" into the film , it is worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he ""did not want to just do another slasher film after urban legend"" and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something ""more adult"" . other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material , the novel of the same name by tom savage . the novel's characters , setting and plot are very different from the film . sellers has said , ""while it was a fine book , i did not think it was the right story for a film"" . so instead the novel , which is much dryer and more serious in tone , was used as a launching pad , a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on valentine's day . while those facts will not help purists familiar with the book like the film , it is helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude . it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme . blanks' direction is impeccable visually . valentine's day has a lush look throughout , with complex , deep colors , interesting sets , and good staging . blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark , with clearly conveyed action . he also directs his actors with aplomb , catalyzing often slyly humorous performances . david boreanaz , as adam carr , is involved in many of the funniest moments . while valentine's day is no masterpiece , it is a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions . if you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more .",1,9
"most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else . i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable . however , because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films . a perfect example was the john garfield film air force--in which a b-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the japanese air force ! however , pride of the marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner . when i first saw this film , i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true . however , after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor . this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true !",1,9

"i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment , but it was just boring . it appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends , and from there casually decided to make a movie . it is frequently unwatchable . lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road , with the same music played repeatedly . unfortunately , renee harmon is barely in the movie . harmon probably would have livened things up . perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed . of course , the bikers terrorize a small town . fights , murder , a cowardly cop , a goofy mechanic , etc . one of the bikers always wears a football helmet , a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws . the script has nothing to offer . one scene features a biker assaulting a woman , yelling in the lady's face ""you're all the same ! you're all the same !

"it seems to me that stephen king's ""bachman"" pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer , rawer , more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without 'contaminating' his 'brand name' . if you look back at the ""bachman books"" ( running man , the long walk , roadwork , thinner ) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream king . i realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated , blood-covered , emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom . . . but mainstream king always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit , and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling . bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly . ( btw , ""pet semetary"" could have easily been a bachman book if king had not revealed the alias by then . and ""the dark half"" seems to be at least partially about his ""bachman"" persona . ) ""thinner"" was the last bachman book , and man , with its themes of class warfare , revenge , and death by starvation , it is nasty . so it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit . what is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a ""tv movie of the week"" level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release . ( these days , something like this would probably go directly to dvd or cable ) . the makeup work and the striking motif ( starving to death in the midst of plenty , a metaphor for the overfed , undernourished american middle class if there ever was one ) is all that keeps you watching this misfire . what went wrong ? my first thought is that the director was going for the nasty bachman vibe , but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here ( with the exception of joe monetegna ) simply cannot carry the movie . and then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure . plus he could not leave the plot alone , and his changes do not really help . the script and dialog ought to work , but mostly the movie just lies there . everything is muffled , dull , airless , and no fun to watch . . . with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting . . . . thinner , and thinner , and thinner . as other have pointed out , ""thinner"" is by no means the worst king movie ever made ( or even the second worst ) . and it does have a dreadful , compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work . but first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations .",0,4
"i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest , and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make . and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it . as far as i'm concerned , landon was one of the worst actors on earth , and his artistic license went way over the top , similar to his massacre of the ""little house"" book series is proof . the acting , for lack of a better word , is atrocious , the screenplay sloppy , and there are more close-ups of landon's puss than should be allowed . this movie reflects everingham's story as much as ""little house on the prairie"" reflects the books is was ""based"" on . it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair .",0,1
"david lynch's ( 1999 ) film of john roach / mary sweeney's story is set in iowa and wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release . we come into the life of alvin straight ( richard farnsworth ) late on in life . his medical condition is poor , his life is mostly behind him and he knows it . this makes what he decides to do , even more remarkable and endearing . he decides ( and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions ) to put a few things straight . alvin is , by this time in his life , a man of great experience but modest means . his daughter rose ( sissy spacek ) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf . but it is worth it , because rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses . this film is the story of a journey . but like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense . early on in the film , we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey , which no elderly gentleman of alvin's age should reasonably undertake . but along the way , we slowly learn how alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective . his objective is very simple and straightforward . his brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him . he has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time . along the way , alvin meets many people . the way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film . we come to know who alvin straight is , from what alvin straight does . and at the end of the film , we know who we are . . better .",1,10

"even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific . it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this . with a string of anti-military/anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office , it is almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script . at first , it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusack ( s ) all over again . but only about 90 seconds into the movie , it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelove . i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one . i have to say that i do not know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it . cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide . tom cruise was never close to being this far gone . not even close .",0,1
"snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . the plot is pretty much foreseeable , the characters are stereotypes , the editing too exaggerated . anyway , the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions . instead , i think this is a straight commercial thing . including a character from the french part of switzerland ( the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band's called sens unik ) seems to aim to a larger audience . a straight german-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa . what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie . sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips ! i also think the topic of ""young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives"" is a wide spread reality in zurich . therefore , it should be elaborated with more care . i hope samir got enough money with snow white , in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills .",0,4

"gone in 60 seconds / ( 2000 ) *** ( out of four ) ""gone in 60 seconds"" is an energetic , slick , stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles . if you are a viewer interested in cars this production , by producer jerry bruckheimer ( ""con air , "" ""the rock"" ) , is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles . although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas , its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride . the film stars giovanni ribisi ( ""the mod squad"" ) as a young crook named kip raines , who , as the movie opens , fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) . when kip's life is threatened because of such , his older brother , randall ""memphis"" raines ( nicolas cage ) , a retired but skillful car thief , is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival : steel fifty cars-specified by model , color , year , and make-in only four days . memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist . the crew includes sara ""sway"" wayland ( angelina jolie ) , a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing memphis through previous business , a fellow named mirror man ( t . j . cross ) , the aging and wise otto halliwell ( robert duvall ) , as well as tumbler ( scott caan ) , atley jackson ( will patton ) , toby ( william lee scott ) , and donny astricky ( chi mcbrde ) . contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives , roland castlebeck ( delroy lindo ) and drycoff ( timothy olyphant ) , who suspect from previous experience that memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them . there is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core , stylish atmosphere . to make matters even worse for the film , the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone . i am not stating i think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; i actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an r-rating . however , i do believe in a movie such as ""gone in 60 seconds , "" to strongly develop the character's enlightenment , dialogue needs to be believable and authentic . in spite of problems , the characters are effective due to the top notch , perfectly cast performers responsible . nicolas cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing . angelina jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here . delroy lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable . giovanni ribisi , scott caan , robert duvall , will patton , and christopher eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles . the film contains standard structure , with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives , sets up a fast-paced theme of action , but lacks depth and strong character introduction . in the second act we run into a few more problems : the story wastes time during much of this segment , never really building up for the third act . while the middle of the movie occupies much time , and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot , not a whole lot happens . the third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed . the soundtrack to ""gone in 60 seconds"" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes . it is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults . dominic sena , whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials , has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in ""gone in 60 seconds"" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion , thrills , and excitement but not much more .",1,7
"the problems with nikhil advani's salaam-e-ishq are many . a one-line concept that looks good on paper ( which also worked in an earlier english film - love actually ) goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing . a well-intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition . a director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film ( kal ho na ho ) - try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick . the problem is - what worked fabulously in kal ho na ho were the emotional excesses of the karan johar school of film-making , but here , 'emotion' does not quite grace us with its appearance on the screen - no , not even cursorily . the writer/ director gives us 'six relationships with one common problem - love' , but where is the intensity , where is the depth , where is the 'emotion' ? a 'tribute to love' sans emotion ? and one that goes on and on and on . . . . . . nah , it just cannot work ! in my opinion , the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be 'complete' , it should - in some way or the other - follow the graph of the traditional three-act structure ( screen writing guru , syd field's paradigm ) . that's the real reason why salaam-e-ishq did not work for me . none of the stories had any depth or a roller-coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream hindi cinema . also , the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced . it's not clear what salman khan is doing at ayesha takia's wedding . if he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap-up , why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding ? that would be neater . but yes , some of the stories did have a lot of promise . for one , the anil kapoor-juhee chawla story tries to address a very real situation - mid-life crisis , but its journey is so linear that you are left wondering if it was really an issue . similarly , the problem of commitment in the akshaye khanna-ayesha takia story is also true to life . if only it was developed a little better . i felt that the more promising stories in this mish-mash were told from the male point of view , which is fine , but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters - juhee chawla and ayesh takia in particular - have all the depth of a half-filled bath tub . wasn't this film supposed to be about '12 different lives' ? now the actors . john abraham still needs to learn acting , while vidya balan is dependable and endearing as ever . anil kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character . since she did not get a meaty character to portray , juhee chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it . akshaye khanna is fine despite going a trifle over-the-top in a few scenes . ayesha takia has nothing much to do , but she does remind us that she is the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in dor . govinda tries to make up for that huge mistake called bhagam bhag , and succeeds to a large extent . that brings me the most irritating track of the film ( which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time ) - salman khan and priyanka chopra . the track is irritating mainly because of them . but i must credit them for their consistency . they're consistently bad all through the film . priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming - i do not buy the crap that her role ( that of an 'item girl' ) required her to act over-the-top . somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming . if you have seen rakhi sawant ( who seems to be the inspiration behind this role ) in her interviews and bigg boss you will know what i mean . i strongly feel that if nikhil advani had taken rakhi sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like priyanka , the story would have worked better . salman khan's phony accent is . . . . . well , shannon esra's hindi is less accented than salman's . to be fair to the director , he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film . i particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the anil kapoor-juhee chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence , and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman . but will anyone choose to paint their house in varying , depressing shades of grey ? that's acceptable cinematic license i would say . but when the film runs almost for 4 hours , it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his 'touch' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences . maybe nikhil advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible- pata nahin , kal ho na ho .",0,4

"lucky me ! i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot-in-texas 'horror' flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you . . . i've rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made' from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy ( i'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one ! ) from all indications , it was shot on dv , and it does not really 'look' all that bad quality-wise for digital , but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts ! the story ( slight and cliche as it is ) goes as follows . . . an executive ( ken hebert , who also scripted and co-produced with the director ) takes skeptical co-worker tracy ( amanda watson ) and horny married couple mark and susan ( hank fields and chris buck ) along on a weekend getaway to a ( yawn ) secluded cabin `12 miles' from the nearest town . on the way there , they pick up a bitchy/slutty hitchhiker ( melissa bale ) in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity-yackin , pot-smokin friends' disappears one-by-one , with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates . the killer clown does not even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box ( aside from being morbidly obese ) . it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods , chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes . i cannot say enough bad things about the cast , especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick , who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times . doesn't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense , originality , intelligence , general coherence or humor . i could go on for days on how inept this film is , how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is , but i'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy-this-sucks kind of way . also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s . i . c . k .

"i first saw this movie on mst3k . and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes , i do not particularly think this movie was all that bad . sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget , but it had a very hitchcock-like plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the non-mst3k version , i was genuinely entertained . this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake .",0,4
"of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s , this has to rank as one of the strangest , and most fun to watch . i say that because of the four main actors : orson welles , rita hayworth , everett sloane and glenn anders . the first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me , especially anders . his character , ""george grisby , "" is one of the strangest people i've ever seen on film . his voice , and some of the things he said , have to be heard to be believed . slaone is not far behind in the ""strange"" category . hayworth is not as glamorous with short , blonde hair but still is hayworth , which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy . welles' is as fascinating as always . one tip : if you have the dvd , turn on the english subtitles . his character in this movie is an irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says . welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups . you also have a unique ending , visually , with a shootout in a house of mirrors . great stuff ! as bizarre as this film is , i still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene . other than that , no complaints . this is great entertainment , which is the name of the game .",1,9
"i rented this movie , thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece . what i got was a piece of pure garbage . this movie was confusing in most spots , choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots . mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best . ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects . fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley; at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie . the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably . almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen . jay rodan was almost good as agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with . rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting . in the end , i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds . i'm so glad i did not spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater . if they have been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century , it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work . if i had been there , they would not have hear the play over the snoring . thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes . guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end !",0,1
"i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible , but it was far from great . mediocre at absolute best . i seems though that every time one type of movie is released , a second must be around the same time . ( think about armageddon and deep impact , volcano and dante's peak ) night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects . i have nothing against the actors who starred in it , even if they were not great , it was the movie itself , the directing , the special effects , the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret . a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage . i really do not know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other , but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt .",0,4

"it's just breathtaking in it is awfulness-- you really must see it ! depending on your perspective , dylan walsh is either the savior or the problem here : since he is the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection , he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws , or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness . i'm inclined to the later view-- thanks to him , it works as high comedy . he's the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball , his skill set just does not apply in this context , and his discombobulation is delicious . the real treat though is ms . eastwood , whose inability to speak in plain english is so pervasive i actually googled her , expecting to learn that she was a russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically , with no understanding of their meaning . but no : she is just a talent free american who will leave you laughing with every line she drops . whether she knew what the lines meant must remain an open question .",0,1

"most horror movies are in fact horrible movies . they get to be same ol'-same ol' . same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill ( usually 'splatter' ) and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects . one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience . for instance , i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second . it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended , it grew roots . subtlety can be more terrifying . less is more . i first saw 'the woman in black' on the a&e channel . after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it . this movie almost has the feel of a 'masterpiece theater' production . that was fine with me , i've always preferred british tv & movies anyway . most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced . but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility . the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy . the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable . hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc . hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity . the woman only makes about five appearances in the film . most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright . if she appeared too often , it could have cheapened the mood that gets set . however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we are led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible . the scene where she 'visits' arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror . this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made . i have a copy of 'the haunting' , 'the changling' and a zillion more . i have not seen anything that tops 'the woman in black' yet although i'm still looking . this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic ( like me ) a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts . i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i'd see her staring through my window , etc . maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate . this is how a really great horror film should be . like a lafanu novel , the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it , she is squeezing the life out of you and then it is too late . closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen . . . and it is a terrible shame that this is out of print . i just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie . it's a major prize in my collection . now i'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama .",1,10
"i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it is entirety and i'm glad i did . i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved . naive high school graduates , best friends since childhood , take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble . they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring . taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble . everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer ""yankee hank"" . hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice ( claire dane ) . however , the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized . the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene ( beckinsale ) had me in tears . i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it .",1,9

"how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing . now , eight viewings later , it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it . screenwriters jeffery price & peter s . seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen . ron howard's direction brought the story to full life , and jim carrey's typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show . some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story . having read the original story , i must say i cannot agree . the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story . indeed , it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was . *mild spoilers* ( they probably would not ruin the movie for you . . . but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you have seen it , you should skip the next two paragraphs . ) i think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's terrible experiences in school . i think all of us , at one time or another , were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on . i know i was . . . and that is why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through . and cindy lou who's naive idealism , believing that nobody can be all bad , was heart rending . when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance , cindy lou was determined to be his friend . if only everyone could have such an attitude . in fact , i think the only thing that might have made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content . it was already pretty restrained , but any of this adult humor ( like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whovier's cleavage ) just does not fit in a story like this . this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic , taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must-see of every christmas season .",1,9

"we tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates , powered by large groups of enslaved people , and a lot of money for the white owners . it lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves . some of these children just became more slaves , and others were free . . . but free and coloured , which back then meant anything but , relative to the lot of their sires . a class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able , to a certain extent , to own property , raise themselves from downtrodden to educated , and to attain a comparative dignity . that is to say , they were not slaves , but they were still exploited to a certain extent . often , the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth , set up in their own houses , with allowances , schooling paid for for their children , and a kind of gentility , dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families . in essence , they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity , and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called pla age . feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman , the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman , and the people who touched on their lives , in both a negative and a positive way . the tale was an eye-opener for me , a new zealander , with no real conception of the black/white lines , let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly . the characters are very three dimensional , and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel , by anne rice . the parts are well-cast , the costumes are wonderful , and the brutal way the lines are drawn out , with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through . the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites , the slaves could not help themselves , and the whites , even the sympathetic ones , could not bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on . i recommend this story , both the novel and the miniseries , to everyone , unreservedly . if you cannot handle the truth you will cringe and cower through some parts , as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour , both by their white oppressors , and by their own people . bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality , and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it . i know it may sound callous , but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me , despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on , and i thoroughly enjoyed it . watch it . if not read up on the period , because there is a lesson to be learned from it all .",1,9
"what a brilliant film . i will admit it is very ambitious , with the subject matter . at a little over two and a half hours , it is a very long film too . but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way . cry freedom , despite the minor flaws it may have , is a powerful , moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid . it is true , that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact . people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko . i may be wrong , but although it is biko's story , it is told in the perspective of woods , so woods is an important character in conveying biko's story to the world . cry freedom visually looks amazing . with the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast . the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot . george fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes . it was subtle in scenes in the second half , but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes . the script was of exceptional quality , the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff . the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about , whether it was the police's attack of the south african citizens or biko's death . the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch , but is compensated by how it is shot , performed and written . and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well . the performances were exceptional from the entire cast , from the most minor character to the two leads , there was not a single bad performance . regardless of the accents that is , but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in . denzel washington in one of his more understated performances , gives a truly compelling performance as biko , and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy , for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington's . and the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note . penelope wilton is lovely as donald's wife wendy , and she is a great actress anyway . out the supporting performances , and there may be some bias , two stood out for me . one was timothy west , who relishes his role as captain dewet . the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as kruger . lord richard attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual . overall , a truly wonderful film . ambitious and long it is , but never ceases to be compelling , powerful and achingly moving . a definite winner from lord richard attenborough , and worthy of a lot more praise . 10/10 bethany cox",1,10

"a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker . the fact is , steven spielberg , probably our greatest story-teller , has been doing this in various movie formats for years . the color purple , at the time , was considered risky , especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark . in hindsight , this film should have come as no surprise , for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in e . t . critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare . it is quite an entrance . no special effects , no swashbuckling , just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by alice walker . one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about african-americans in the deep south . slavery is gone , but in the south depicted here , it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves . spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience . this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations . it is the first in a line of films people either did not see or would not see because there are no aliens . empire of the sun , always , schindler's list , etc . . his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a ) he uses mostly untrained , first-time actors , b ) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen , and c ) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years . it is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult . whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie , an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover , who she only knows as ""mister"" . the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with ""mister"" . the pg-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel . this is not ""the burning bed"" in georgia by any means . there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected . it happens gracefully . goldberg perfectly plays a human being , someone in need of love and someone who deserves it . the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister , nettie ( played by akosua busia ) are separated , maybe forever . ( possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent ? ) you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence . the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people . there really is something to live for , but love triumphs over all . spielberg bashers take note : the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens . rating : 10 of 10",1,10

"lame movie . completely uninteresting . no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down . the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum . they manage to switch vehicles a few times , but always end up right on the tail of the baddies . the scene where hartnett grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be . he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die , which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty . it just came off as moronic , totally unbelievable and even cruel . some subplots were not even explored , they were just used as filler . why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes ? why , and on what grounds , is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief ? why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist ? for some reason , even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor , ( he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer's house to jack up his own commission ) , they keep coming back to him anyway ! they knew he lied to both of them ! yet there they were , coming to terms that both said they would never go for . stupid , just stupid . this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders . there they were , just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover . amazing that they did not hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each . . . . the scriptwriting was terrible , the action sequences were boring , the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett . it fails miserably . and ford's phone ! turn the damn thing off ! how many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie ? 50 ? 60 ? it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie ! every 30 seconds , that stupid tune would play ! and if it was not ford's , then hartnett's was ringing ! it was incredibly annoying ! complete waste of time , ford's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights , which was without a doubt , the lowest point of his distinguished career .",0,3

"a good cast and they do their best with what they are given , but the story makes no sense , the characters' actions are inexplicable , and there are too many moments of unintentional humor , as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off . the scene when the two witch and her victim ( played by the same actress ) are in the house together sets up like a 3 stooges routine , and the plot begs the question : if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul , why does not she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase ? not to be missed is christopher walkin's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife ( paraphrased ) : ""the ancient egyptianas - they wee materialists . they expected the body to last through eternity , like a used car that you souped up . but the druids , they knew you could not drive in the afterlife . you had to get out and walk .

"isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor . the director of ""la pianiste"" understands this , providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face , and these are a pleasure to see . huppert is not an animated actor--she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile . other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession , there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it . ( well , if you enjoy self-mutilation , sado-masochism , and bizarre behavior , ""la pianiste"" might work for you . other than these attributes , i could not find any redeeming value in it . ) buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth . people who compete at the very highest level--musically , athletically , whatever--begin as strange people , and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment . not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson .",0,3
"with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series , like with any hit cinema event , there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard . with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju ( giant monster ) genre . many sought after success; a few gained it . one of the few that not only profited , but garnered popularity was gamera , a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion . but unlike godzilla , gamera was marketed as a friend to all children , later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril , and thus gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies . unfortunately , that is about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to . while the new gamera movies directed by shusuke kaneko are marvelous , revolutionary monster movies , the original series , including the original , is nothing special . the first gamera movie , titled in japan as ""the giant monster gamera"" was clearly a godzilla want-to-be . even though the movie was produced in the era of color films , it was shot in black-and-white . why ? to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s . gamera also attacks tokyo . because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie . i do not know much about the japanese version , for the version i am familiar with the americanized version , where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted ( is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film ? ) now whether this adds or takes away from the film , i cannot say . but ""gammera the invincible"" is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself . ""gammera the invincible"" is a very routine-orientated movie . the characters are from a stock of science-fiction standards , the story is inane , the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization , the acting is laughable , and so on and so forth . the only thing that differentiates it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie , but that is also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts gamera's rampage is completely phony and ridiculous . now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description , but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie . and although shusuke kaneko would later transform gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s , in the original series , gamera was not an attractive screen presence . he was neither scary nor sympathetic . he just waddles around like a toddler , swaying with each step , and knocks miniature sets over . as usual , everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid ( yoshio uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a 'central' role ) who thinks gamera is a nice turtle . most movies in the genre that ""gammera the invincible"" is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure . even in the company of many other godzilla-imitators , this gamera film is not a particularly good entry . and as far as my cinema experience goes , the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse . like godzilla , gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters . and like godzilla , he would get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again . it's peculiar . usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes . but in the case of gamera , my verdict is just the opposite . i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by shusuke kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested . the new films are inventive , well-made , exciting , and above all , fun . the original series is a long stream of boredom .",0,4
"this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone , but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . women and performers ( both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star ) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china . this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture . the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance . a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .",1,8

"i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie , based on the box art , i thought would be fun , and yes , bad . prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box . i sat down and watched , and lo ! and behold ! , found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind . fortunately , i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total . prison tells the story of an old , dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns . it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners . the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film . the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair . we see lane smith as a guard - tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker . we then go to present day , first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re-opening the old prison . then we see the new warden , lane smith , haunted by a nightmare in bed - and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years . well , the rest follows suit : prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding . we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters . the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job . viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid . tom everett , tiny lister , and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters . chelsea field is okay as the female lead . the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick , an underrated character actor , as cresus - a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the ""man"" had been executed"" with some kind of terrible secret . prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that , but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it . i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric . the film has a tense , taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes . there are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes . but these scenes are visually creative and interesting . the acting is uniformly decent . the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these . that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story . you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday . here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is . give prison a break ( get it ) .",1,7

"feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father , a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi . for a story that is as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell , it is a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically . gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school . now the film aims to convey one very interesting point - the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person , ended up being an unfair father . this point is made in the film many times over , and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england , which gandhi twice denies his son . instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head , the director just moves along with the story , thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father . which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal , it comes off looking like he is over-reacting . the point i'm trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did . we never really understand why he turned to islam , and then back again to hinduism . the thing is , we never really understand harilal at all . and that is because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle , a story most of us are already familiar with . to put it simply , gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father-son relationship , but it does not so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in . we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi's son , but show us why that was a burden to begin with . show us incidents of their early conflict . for example , it is not enough that gandhi merely says he is opposed to harilal's early marriage , tell us why this opposition ? it's not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out - for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa , for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate . words are not enough , show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi . what's more , instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship , the film goes off on too many tangents , thus diluting the impact of the central theme . this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence , and yet on many occasions that is exactly what it seems like , because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment , even though much of it has no relevance to the film's basic premise - the stormy father-son relationship . so you see the problem with this film is not that it is a bad film , but it is certainly a very confused film . what happens to harilal's children after his wife's death ? does he ever have relationship with them ? where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba ? none of these questions are answered in a film that is basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family . the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself , gandhi my father is a disappointment , no questions asked . cinematically , it struggles to translate the filmmaker's ambitious intention to the screen . practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade-ins and fade-outs , never quite seamlessly leading into each other . on the positive side , there is inherent nobility in the film , which you recognise . the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative , trying hard not to take sides , never once judging either father or son , painting neither as the villain . what the film does do , however , is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation , but evidently alienated his family . of all the actors in the film it is only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck-deprived harilal gandhi . it's a wonderful performance , and it is not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character . but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure . just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife's dead , and you will realise how much he conveys through body language alone . darshan jariwala , meanwhile , who plays gandhi senior , adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years , but it is the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor's best contribution to that role . the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba , the woman who is meant to be torn in this father-son conflict , but if she is unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it is really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script . much effort's gone into the making of this film and that is evident throughout , but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you will remember about it when you leave the cinema - it is just so boring . director feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes , but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay . what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy . and with this film , the director makes us too .",1,9
"contains spoilers . the british director j . lee thompson made some excellent films , notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear' , but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings . the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland , and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson , an eccentric aristocratic landowner , his sister hilary , and hilary's estranged husband douglas , who is hoping for a reconciliation with her . we learn that during his career as an army officer , charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre' . this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world , and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle . the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum . peter o'toole was , when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia' , one of britain's leading actors , but the quality of his work was very uneven , and 'country dance' is not one of his better films . he overacts frantically , making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat , as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper-class twit of the year' sketch . susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better , but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film . there is also little in the way of coherent plot , beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide . the main problem with the film , however , is neither the acting nor the plot , but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name . there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary , or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part , and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy . unfortunately , even in the swinging sixties and early seventies ( the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 ) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow , and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits . ( the american title for the film was 'brotherly love' , but this was not used in britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc ? ) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse , resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre . 4/10",0,4

"given its time of release , the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'panic in the streets' was hardly a surprise . the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague . yet with the current drama in the world today , this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers . the cast and crew are flawless . richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'night and the city , ' jack palance in his chilling film debut , also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young ( and rather cute ) barbara bel geddes . a whole slew of uncredited , non-professional actors ( typical of director kazan ) fill in the remaining slots . elia kazan directs , joe macdonald films ( he would later work with richard widmark again in 1953's much superior 'pickup on south street' ) and the great alfred newman scores it . nearly everyone involved here has done better work , 'panic in the streets' is quite the rewarding watch , nonetheless . especially for the film-noir enthusiast .",1,7

"despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential . set as a prequel to the original ""star trek"" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer , rick berman , who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a ""star trek"" series could be ( which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint ) . the actual show-runner , brannon braga , did not help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology ( it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck ) . never have i seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors ( jolene blaylock excepted ) last so long . it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience ( even a trekker audience ) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires . unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that ""enterprise"" suffered from ""franchise fatigue"" and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off . produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they ( the audience ) will come . simply put , in a teevee universe where we are given shows like ""battlestar : galactica"" and ""the shield"" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a ""star trek"" that measures up and is dramatically competitive . it is just that straightforward and easy .",0,1
"amazing performance from simon pegg who just gets better and better with every role . as usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes , but thats what pegg is all about . the laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at penn . the movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the director robert weide . and i cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson who shone throughout . highly recommended to all .",1,9
"this movie is like real life , by which i mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so , and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast ( their invisibility being due to the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers ) . a big bore . no big surprise that altman helms this - he is a very variable performer ( yes we all loved ""gosford park"" , but ""pret a porter"" anyone ? kansas city ? dr t . and the women ? aaargh ) , but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale , and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film . and no , it is not ""so bad it is good"" . it's just bad .",0,1
"as part of our late 1950s vocabulary , we well knew the ponderosa , little joe , hoss , ben cartwright , etc . on that great show ""bonanza . "" it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set . this was a real show depicting family values . there may have been a weekly crisis , but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together . lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family . his words depicted wisdom . we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright , a widower , must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died . he reared wonderful sons . naturally , we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show . the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed . his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son . he should have tried to get back into the series . he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out .",1,9
"i'm a nice guy , and i like to think of myself as genre-tolerant . and , i guess by that , i mean i try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in . if nothing else , that saves me from feeling like i should be saying really nasty things about people or films , which i do not like doing . the plot in this one was patently obvious , the production values very low and sets , uhm , simplistic . the acting rose into ""good for a high school play"" territory from time to time . my feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was . worst of all , the sex , while reasonably plentiful , was fairly mundane , hampered by , at least in my copy , a ""sound-over"" that was inconsistent with the action ( climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra ? ? ? ) . there was definitely no ""edge"" to it at all--nothing distinguishing or interesting , and with surprisingly quick cuts . my vote is a ""1"" then , with the following summary statement : would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded , and the rest of the movie condensed .",0,1
"canto 1 : how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attila woos her through his ambassador r diger von bechlarn : kriemhild ( margarete sch n ) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband , hagen tronje ( hans adalbert schlettow ) , but her brother , king gunther ( theodor loos ) , refuses her request . when king attila of the huns woos kriemhild through his ambassador r diger von bechlar , she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her . hagen tronje hides the nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake . canto 2 : how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland and how she was received by king attila : kriemhild brings some earth from where siegfried died , and travels to the court of the huns , where she is welcomed by attila himself , who also promises through oath to defend her . canto 3 : how king attila besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers : when kriemhild delivers a baby boy , attila returns to his realm and asks kriemhild what she would like most to please her . she asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom . canto 4 : how kriemhild receives her brothers : kriemhild insists on having the head of hagen tronje , but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request . canto 5 : how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen : kriemhild asks attila to kill hagen tronje , but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert , a guest is considered sacred . kriemhild offers gold to the hums for the head of hagen tronje . there is a fight , and hagen tronje kills attila's son . canto 6 : the nibelungen's distress : the huns lose the battle against the nibelungen , but keep them under siege inside attila's castle . kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver hagen tronje , but her brother gunther tells that german people are loyal with their friends . canto 7 : the nibelungen's end : after the death of r diger von bechlarn , giselher and gernot , hagen tronje and guhther are finally captured . kriemhild kills hagen tronje , ending her revenge with the destruction of the nibelungen . the conclusion of the poetic saga of siegfried through ""kriemhild's revenge"" is also told through seven dramatic cantos . the nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy , adventure , romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate , revenge and loyalty . the solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters , the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of fritz lang produced another epic ahead of time . margarete sch n is impressive with a total different woman , obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish . the costumes that kriemhild wears are also very impressive , and her acting is based on her face and look . i was a little disappointed with the reaction of attila after the death of his only son , since i found it too passive . my vote is eight . title ( brazil ) : ""os nibelungos parte ii : a vingan a de kriemshild"" ( ""the nibelungen part ii : kriemhild's revenge"" )",1,8
"this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching . everything was unbelievably clich and retarded . the acting was horrible too . the camera work was not bad but that still could not redeem it . the writer/director of this film must suffer from down's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career . i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap . i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this . i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it . the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled ""disappearances"" . i do not know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least $20 for my time , pain and suffering . in conclusion , the director/writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street .",0,1
"this is quite a dull movie . well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over , it fails because the director takes no position , stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates . one of france's revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu - i believe they made 7 together - pialat fails to engage . it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around . isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""i do not know""; ""i like his arms""; ""i like the way he makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because . . . i assume he loves her . so he accepts and hope for what ? that she will one day wake up and come to her senses . things like this are not answered in pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up . i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand . jules et jim , this is not . the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving .",1,7
this is a great canadian comedy series . the movie tells of how the stars jean paul tremblay- ( julian ) and the head writer of the show and his buddies rickie and bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of said trashy hoods . the movie will tell you why rickie and julian begin doing their more advanced forays into the world of crime . why and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so i shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades . their friend and oft-time partner ( bubbles ) is a brilliant character . the whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit-com one bit . it is a comedy with a capital c and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams . if you ever have the opportunity to watch--buy--steal this program grab it . you will be glad you did . and to my american friends---it will break you up also . 10 out of 9 . brilliant . tv how tv should be .,1,10

"visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy , this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark , the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced . the special effects are beautiful and imaginative . the plot is a bit on the cerebral side , but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons . if thinking is not your forte , however , this may not be your movie . maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no brain club , but if you are looking for something more , he is where you will find it .",1,10
"this is a re-imagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now . there's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend . there's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan does not speak . there's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in 1910 , could be this offensively stupid and plastic . bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold , as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project . if it succeeds anywhere it is in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed . it would be ridiculous to argue that movies should not employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers . some really great film moments incorporate it . but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here; at the time of its release and now . you sit through awful , dumb scenes that offer no interest , and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies . yes . . . bo derek and miles o'keeffe are beautiful ( um , congratulations on having a working libido . ) but if that is your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up . there's only a hairs-breadth difference between the two formats and ( i'm just guessing here ) a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter . the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone . as a showman , john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie ""10""; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads . the movie itself was beside the point . he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid , shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality . as a director , john derek appears to require only that mrs . derek look pleasant , empty and hump-able in every scene . it's hideously shot . the camera placement is annoying . in terms of editing , the entire 'wipe' catalog is exhausted . the credit sequence is garish . and it is a toss-up as to who commits the worse screen offense; bo derek who is such a bimbo that she cannot even figure out how to play a bimbo , or richard harris who shouts every line ( as he likes to do ) until you want to shoot him . at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her .",0,2
"my 3 year old loved it . i loved it , my wife loved it . so 10 out of 10 from our family . as for violence level ? not really that violent , mostly of the slap stick variety . nobody truly dies , no gore , no blood , no torture , so it certainly is appropriate for children , much more so than many saturday morning cartoons . this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go . first of all beautiful graphics , textures wonderfully done , with true depth , not trying to be realistic , but forming an artistic whole . the moss on the stones , the rust on metal , the reliefs on the wood and the stone , everything adds to the whole . character modeling , unlike many contemporary cg movies , is quirky , not cute , again within an artistic whole . the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies , but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like . i think that is a good thing , it lends veracity , how strangely it may sound , it is easier to suspend your disbelief . hair , fur , clothing , on par , at least with the likes of pixar . just note in the opening scenes when lian-chu is fighting the giant slug; gwizdo is in front of some farmers , and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it . the setting . far beyond the likes of cars , and even wall e . space has been done many times , but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings , but again it is an artistic whole , and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly . magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc . where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility , or wall e where we see the immense trash towers he made , abound in this movie , everything is grand , yet never dwelt upon; it is just the background the whole way ! the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls . the chinese wall , the islands floating in the sky . the broccoli in the sky ? that is truly where i believe cg should go , make something which takes your breath away , and do it again and again . the sound is good , the music is varied and not only epic , and thankfully without any vocals , and purely original for the movie . animation is quite good . lending its inspiration to cartoons , especially some good use of stretch and squeeze . sometimes not that realistic , but the 3d models are not realistic either . characterization is well done too . lian-chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zo . gwizdo the wily manager of lian-chu redeems himself in the end , while zo is not really changed at all , but who wants that cute child to change anyway ? i at least loved lian-chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc . the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures , just as it should in a proper fantasy story . the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story , especially how the world brakes apart . the monsters are pretty standard fare , except the flocking one . it lacks the emotional impact of wall e , which is the really strong point of that movie , but it is a much more fun ride , and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one , and has action from the first scene . this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time . the whole movie has , as i've mentioned a whole vision , which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout . it seems , that the setting is ready for more adventures , and i for one would hope so . one side note , the french actor doing lian-chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first , but i'm happy it was not him , though he is one of my favorites . nice to hear a new , to me , voice . i give it a max rating , a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some; i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote . approach this movie as an adventure , and as a european movie , not opposed to hollywood , but different .",1,10

"city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country , state or any sort of major political table . granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena , especially nowadays , but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand . director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising , malice , and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault . i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama , not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out . . . what else . . . or rather who else . . . al pacino . the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city . as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss , and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city . as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up . i absolutely hate talking about al pacino . i mean even if once he did not give a good performance how could i ever say it ? the man is acting royalty . there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor . in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor . he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician . he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i've ever seen at the 'james bone' funeral . i re-watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it , my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud . its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino . john cusack , who i really do enjoy as an actor , turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun . he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance . . . he seems like he is trying too hard . his accent is just bizarre , and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he does not get seem to pull it off . maybe he was having an off film . bridget fonda , on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan . her performance is very similar to cusack's in that she just does not seem to find her groove with this character . danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo . martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter stern . the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors . everyone is . . . okay . there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy . and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he is absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film . it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them . so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics . if you just will not see this movie than find pacino's speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying does not seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it . if you are a john cusack fan which i am . . . he is definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice . a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss . 7 . 5/10",1,7
"i know technically this is not the greatest tv show ever , i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it . the acting can at time be also a little crumby . but , i love this show so much . it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988 . of course it would i was 5 years old . but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes , which unfortunately i hear is now deleted . and i also heard warner's are not going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales . also the tv show did not have the same feel as the movies , in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone . even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4 ( both that film and the tv show were made the same year ) , this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey . not a bad thing , i like freddy as the clown wise cracker . but i think that was the strenght of this tv show , you did not have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody . in fact this has more of a dream feel to it , reinforced by the soft focus of the lense . im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video . i love this show , and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable . much better than anything on tv today .",1,10

"" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one . nancy allen ( maggie hewitt ) , ""dressed to kill , "" , '80 , is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast . maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down , western style , with the local top cop in town . this is a different film , however , nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together !",1,10
"i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family . funnily enough , my girlfriend lives in hadfield ( the filming location ) and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited . this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch . besides recognising some of the locations , i found myself not in the least bit surprised . once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world . tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf , fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best . suffice to say i am hooked on the program now . the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge . the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north ( no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place ) . i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run ( which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night , it certainly is ) . well done the bbc ! !",1,10
"so , this movie has been hailed , glorified , and carried to incredible heights . but in the end what is it really ? many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work . the fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated , and scenes that are in asl are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent . the voice interpretation of matlin's dialogue , under the excuse that hurt's character ""likes the sound of his voice"" , turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on . matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view . but nonetheless , most of the movie , when this is a love story , is only showed from a single point of view , that of the man . as ebert said , ""if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate , it is not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them . "" the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as ""revolutionary"" is fairly insulting in itself . his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on . drawing comedy from a deaf accent is , quite honestly , rather low . and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women : as an entitled man . a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated , in a way that is fairly inconsistent with his credentials : i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they were not aware of a deaf person being in the area , and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to . as a lover , he seems like a typical dogged nice guy , including his tendency to act possessively afterwards . and yet the movie is , indeed , only really seen through him , as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice . the scenes involving the other deaf kids are , in general , wallbangers . the broken symbolism fails , the dance scene , the pool scene , even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it - all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors , at best : many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel ( instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas ) , and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness ( no , seriously , when i go swim , i go swim ) . . . it also fails at carrying the end of the play , instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man . even though the original play ended with a more equal ground , where both have to accept each other as they are , and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands , not the vibrations in her throat . and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be , marlee matlin remains hollywood's token deaf woman to this day .",0,3
"when i first saw the trailer for prom night , i have to admit , the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie . so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film , not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people . there was no tension , the characters , how was i supposed to care about them ? they had no development what-so-ever , the killer ? ! oh , my god , this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed , i know it is a film , but why would a man who never ( or at least we know of ) killed any one before , kill a girl's family and friends that he is just obsessed over ? i mean , was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her ? i have no idea , because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror . donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher , who has become very obsessed over her , he was captured and put in jail . it's been 3 years and she is just now getting some peace in her life , she is even going to her senior prom . but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind , he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends , and the hotel maid , and the bell boy , because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are . donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently , just , wow . i'm sorry , i really did want to love this movie , we have not had a good slasher flick in a long time , but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with . just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious . i know that this was a pg-13 movie , but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes ? not to mention no stab holes ? i would not recommend this movie for anyone unless you are a teen , this movie was made for the teenagers , not adults , and not for those who know a real horror movie , no offense to those who did enjoy this film , but i do not understand how anyone could . 2/10",0,2

"daniel day-lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown , the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life , dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer . the film , however , is a very difficult one to review--or even watch . fortunately , i had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater . while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter , i cannot say it is the sort of film i'd want to view more than once . nevertheless , my attention was held by the story-telling device , a flashback framed by the present , in which we see christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him , who certainly gave him loving care . daniel day-lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist ( fiona shaw ) , much to his mother's fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken . there's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much . brenda fricker does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him , his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day-lewis begins to have success with his work . she complements day-lewis' performance as the warm-hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him . richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film . both fricker and day-lewis won oscars , but hugh o'conor and ray mcanally are also excellent . o'conor is christy as a boy and mcanally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy . summing up : elmer bernstein's music is an added plus factor . well worthwhile , but definitely not a film for everyone .",1,7

"while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip , an abused suburban housewife ( basinger ) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn . suffering the indignity of a straight to dvd release here in the u . k . , susan montford's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves . this is a shame , as the standard of the writing , directing and acting is very good indeed , and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick . kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband ( craig sheffer ) . while sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence , it is in their brief scenes together that basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths . it's a truly great , understated performance , her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played . lukas haas i initially thought was miscast , as he ( along with the other three youths ) just did not seem much of a threat . however , had all four youths been more physically imposing , the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all . the fact that these are four average men , albeit slightly unhinged , is the key to why the film works as well as it does . apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there , what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over . some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes , or the abrupt ending . others by the at times brutal violence . i say give it a chance , it is certainly more deserving of your time than saw v .",1,7
"this musical was not quite what i expected , foremost being there were not many scenes between brando and sinatra . as it was based on a damon runyon story , i expected irony and surprise , of which there was one really good one - when we find that sinatra's gang has used the salvation army office for their crap game while brando was in havana with simmons . if course it comes at the right moment too , when brando brings her back . i really did not expect much from brando as a singer , but he surprised me . he was not great but he was just fine in the role . his big number in the sewer , however , with the rest of sinatra's boys was the only place i felt brando's voice was weak . he just did not have the power the grand climax demanded . overall i found the scenes between brando and simmons to be filled with electricity , something i did not think would happen when we first see simmons by herself , and later when we are introduced to brando in the restaurant with sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him . it was not until brando goes to her office that the story came to life . frank sinatra , on the other hand , was flat , even his vocal performances . and vivian blaine , who i never heard of , but who i guess played the role on broadway , just seemed to slow the proceedings down . the scenes between her and sinatra were obvious . also , her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character . on top of that , all the goldwyn girls numbers seemed shoe horned in , just there for glitz . for example , when frank meets with brando in the nightclub , we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number - then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there had not been any dance number at all . whenever brando and simmons were on screen , i was having a great time , but each time we return to the sinatra-blaine story , my interest level waned . as for the songs , there were some good ones , particularly the very first number with stubby kaye , the fugue for tinhorns number ( can do ! ) . that's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in the music man - cash for the merchandise . . . whatever it is called . and the number in the sewer - i could not help but be reminded of ""cool"" from west side story - which brings me to a point . i really did not like the art direction in this film . the fake times square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself . same for the havana sequence , and particularly the sewer . i realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets , but things were changing - carousel , for example , made great use of location photography . even on the town shot scenes in mahattan in 1949 . by the time we get to west side story in 1961 it is a given that stuff taking place in manhattan had to be actually shot in manhattan . so by comparison , guys and dolls set-bound manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute . and changing lindy's to mindy's - did they really have to do that for legal reasons ? now , i always thought guys and dolls was a musical about sinatra and brando and their adventures with various girls . it was much more focused than that , which is to its credit . in that regard it is much better than les girls , which was interesting in it is own right , but had a certain shallowness to it . my one major complaint about guys and dolls , and i do not know if this is endemic to the original stage show , but when jean simmons realizes that brando never took any money for a bet that he made with sinatra and even said that he lost the bet , she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding . it seems to me a scene between brando and simmons would have added to the impact of the story . to see brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene . there is such a scene in the music man ( spoilers ahead ) , when harold and marion have that duet while he is waiting for her to change . she is upstairs in her house , he is down on the sidewalk . he's singing 76 trombones . she is singing goodnight my someone . they suddenly switch and sing each other's songs - a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other . it's an emotional high moment of the film . still , guys and dolls had a lot going for it .",1,7
"a most recommendable masterpiece , not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos , not to mention the acting of giants , mastroianni and moreau , and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis . gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his ""tough"" partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character , which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl ( khrysikou ) and the man ( mastroianni ) , albeit hinted beforehand . ( hence the spoiler . ) get your expectations straight ! it's an ""art movie"" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention . not for spending free time , but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert . due to the overall photographic style , large screen viewing is recommended . dialogues are used sparingly . but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian , kurdish and turkish , which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .",1,10
"here's one you can watch with a straight face , with a script so bad , even will ferrell would not be in it . there are two laughs in hot rod . 1 . the punch-dance . rod ""needs to go to his quiet place"" and before anyone can say kevin bacon , he is footloosing a passionate , overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of europe . 2 . john farnham's you're the voice . in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support , the soundtrack is the gag . how did the film-makers even come across this aussie recording artist ? a major australian vocalist ( and a genuine talent ) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering raindrops keep fallin' on my head , then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you're the voice , john farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy , it leveled mountains in switzerland . besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit . andy samberg is rod , a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump . maybe it is got something to do with the fact he is driving a moped into the heart of darkness . or his fake mustache . yeh , someone actually thought that was funny . without one jump under his starry belt , he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian , like jason biggs or rob schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever . . . who watches these movies for plot anyway ? along the way ( as usual for moronic leads in these comedies ) , he scores a salubrious chick ( isla fisher ) , who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser . sissy spacek ( carrie , 1976 ) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up . ian mcshane must have lost a bet to be here .",0,2

"was this a comedy or was it a drama ? i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed , hollywood shuffle , was neither funny or rather dramatic . while it tried so hard to make a point , because of this lack of definition ( comedy or drama ) , the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost . while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in hollywood , even today , i do not believe that townsend's directorial debut did much to stop it . instead , i feel it only added more fuel to the fire . townsend's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of , he was instead promoting and vice versa . the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy . townsend had a decent concept with this film , but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film . if you watch the preview before the film ( which i constantly do ) , you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see . the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent , comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers , but the actually film could not be further from the truth . the main problem with hollywood shuffle is not story itself ( because it is lacking in elaboration ) ; it is townsend's direction . he had a wonderful concept with this film . exploit the hollywood that exploits our race . decent idea , but why could not he execute it very well ? the first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic . the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital , we are literally everywhere without any warning or map . it was obvious that townsend had quite a bit to say , but only a short amount of time to do it in . so , instead of defining his characters , developing his themes , and actually creating a smart film , he just throws it all together and prays that it works . sadly , it does not . instead of a smart comedy , we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas , comedic skits , and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable . what hurts townsend the most are his brief , attempt to be funny , interruptions throughout the film . from battling a villain known as jerry curl to parodying siskel & ebert , townsend's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters . this is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally . while townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood , he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and clich in the book . what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest . so , if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story , perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story . wrong ! the wayans are in this film , but townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family . definitely in their pre-in living color moments , we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon . perhaps it was townsend's direction , or just maybe this atrocious story , but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film . i just thought that with the talent pool that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny , bright , and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma . sadly , it was none of the above . finally , i would like to say that this was a workable film . there were some moments ( while they were few and way far between ) that had a smile on my face , the final product just did not settle well with me . townsend can be funny , but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself , instead of through his personal experiences and troubles . i realize that he was probably speaking the truth , but it never came through as that . instead , we are threaded through a weak story , which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom , but surely did not work for this film . even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film , i would have to disagree . if you are starting fresh , either have a tight script or defined themes . townsend had neither of these , and combined with the inability to control his actors , he just failed in a ball of flames . overall , this was rather disappointing to watch . it reminded me of a grade school spelling bee where it is finally your child's time to spell . the word is tough , but as the first two to three letters come out , you think that it is going to work perfectly , but then there is that random ""p"" and silent ""r"" that forces your excitement to come tumbling down . that is how i felt with hollywood shuffle . at first , i saw the potential , i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture , but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes , i experienced that deep fall feeling . townsend sank his own ship on this one , and i do not think hollywood shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema . grade : * out of *****",0,2

"this is one of my favorite comedies ever . not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero , but taken for what it is worth and not as trivializing alcoholism , the movie is simply a lot of fun . it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk , irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune , but only if he marries susan , chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him . arthur proposes , but then unwisely falls for linda , a waitress and petty thief . dudley moore is perfect as arthur , the world's most endearing drunk , whose antics are a laugh a minute . admittedly , moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role . the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed . liza minnelli sparkles as linda , and her on screen chemistry with moore is great . jill clayburgh plays susan , the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur . however , this film is literally made by sir john gielgud , who portrays arthur's sarcastic but moral butler , hobson . it's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson's longtime employment . hobson is arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice . the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur's romance at all , but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant . it's the butler you will remember best long after the closing credits roll .",1,8
"every sunday , a trio of buds get together at a nyc diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before . sometimes they are joined by a newlywed ex-comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle . they're unabashed horn dogs/corn dogs and mia , who witnesses them on the prowl , decides that they need to be taught a lesson , dammit . ergo , she will date and dump - why not ? all three of them ! gasp . what a wild idea . what a radical , naughty gal . women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to . as much as men do , even ! there is one solitary laughable element in ""whipped"" - namely the fact that not once , during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash , do the other customers in the diner turn around and say , ""dude , we are trying to eat here . "" indeed , a heh-heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages . a big fat kermit the frog ""sheesh"" to that . it's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting , a smart , cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop-out ending . p . s . - 30 ""whip-oosh"" sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase ""you go , girl"" . it was tired in 2000 , and it is tired now . save your time and watch some ""sex and the city"" reruns . . .",0,1
"for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls , think again . there is a totally different side to the japanese animation . yakitate ! japan is one of those shows . it is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread . his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads . the show is as wacky as they come and i'm sure that non-japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes . but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show . in the world of yakitate ! it is not uncommon for people to look like they have just had an orgasm after eating bread . the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers , from time-traveling to swimming like a fish . that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i've watched in a while .",1,8
"petter mattei's ""love in the time of money"" is a visually stunning film to watch . mr . mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations . this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money , power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter . this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme , the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect . each one is connected in one way , or another to the next person , but no one seems to know the previous point of contact . stylishly , the film has a sophisticated luxurious look . we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat . the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits . a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment , as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter . the acting is good under mr . mattei's direction . steve buscemi , rosario dawson , carol kane , michael imperioli , adrian grenier , and the rest of the talented cast , make these characters come alive . we wish mr . mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work .",1,8
"sex wish was actually released ( minus ten minutes of more , ahem , 'extreme' footage ) here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom , and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case . strangely enough , the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned , and the film has been all but forgotten as a result . i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd-rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor . it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented , a triple-x take on michael winner's death wish ( did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned ? ) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze . if you do not consider yourself to be squeamish , this may force you to think again . by the time sex wish is over , you will want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself . if any film truly deserves the ""it is only a movie , only a movie , only a movie"" tag-line , it is this one . highlights ( or lowlights ) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her , harry reems's scene-stealing moustache , the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer ( they would have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad ) before the man is castrated for his troubles , and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins . don't say i did not warn you . if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago , sex wish will prove you very , very wrong .",0,2
"i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo , and his was easily the stand-out the film's three stories . it was not my favorite of the shorts , but it was the most unique , and the most iconic . ""the lovers on the bridge"" was the first of his full length features i've seen , a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic . though he is classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue , his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives . his movies are closer to jean vigo in ""l'atlante"" , jean cocteau , and guy maddin , than godard and truffaut . in boy meets girl carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states . he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin , but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau , but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible , emotional , and engaging like vigo's movies . the story of boy meets girl is simple , and similar to carax's two following films which comprise this ""young lovers"" trilogy . a boy named alex played by denis lavant ( who plays a character named alex in carax's next two movies ) , has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend . in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder . he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex , and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate . he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment , but avoids contacting either of them directly . he wanders around and finds his way to a party , where he meets a suicidal young woman , and the film becomes part ""breathless"" and part ""limelight"" . later he is advised by an old man with sign language to ""speak up for yourself . . . young people today it's like they forgot how to talk . "" the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film , and how an actor timid off stage became a confident ""lion"" when in front of the camera . heres where the movie tips its hand , but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene , since it overlaps the style of the film ( silent and expressionist ) , with the content ( a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to ) . though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end , he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which are not easy to nail down from moment to moment , aside from a desire to fall in love . there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies , all crying in a chorus that fills that room , until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent . unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses . even as carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell ( the room full of whining infants ) , he is mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses . even the rich old , bell of the ball has a brother she misses . in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence . though indebted to films before talkies , carax is a master of music , knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy's ""holiday in cambodia"" , or an early david bowie song , the sounds of a man playing piano , or of a girl softly humming . in boy meets girl , when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt , when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel , when alex enters a party an feels out of place , its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who cannot speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain , or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut . this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet , michel gondry , and wes anderson , whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy , all have a parallel with different visuals , musical , and emotional cues in these carax movies . every line of dialog , every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level , some i lack words to articulate . there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl , but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment . the other movies you want to watch can wait . see this first . if i were to make films , i would want them to be like this , in fact i wish all films were like this , where the ephemeral becomes larger than life , and life itself becomes a dream .",1,9
"`in the tradition of 'carrie' and 'heathers' ? try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two films , but 'the evil dead' and 'the shining' as well .

( and she is quite creative about it too , accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted hawaiian-punch-guy hat . eat your heart out , cher . ) karen black overacts a bit , but she is not totally without dignity , and you cannot help but sympathize with her .

"the story idea is excellent . unfortunately , the execution lets it down . the movie lacks pace , for one thing . it should be an exciting ride , but it is slow and more than a little boring . i think the problem's mainly in the screenplay and editing . there are not enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense , and there are scenes which do not really move the story along very effectively . the producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite . unfortunately , when the producer is also the writer and the director , this evidently am not gonna happen . much of the acting seems kind of flat , and that is down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects . it's a shame , because with better writing , editing and direction , this could have been a really good thriller .",0,2
"as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles , this little pile of garbage popped up on my ""to rent"" list when i saw it was available . the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots . some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip , though if he returns with the girl and all the money , he gets a significant cut . he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and , wow , that pilot is one of the worst actors ever ! granted , they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood . after stealing away into the jungle , we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour . now , this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever , ping-pong balls for eyes and that is pretty much it . his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack , and i found myself muting much of those scenes . oh , did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity ? this is probably the main reason this film was banned , though there is one specific scene , about one second long , where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out , but it is not a redeeming factor for gore fans . also , jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals , and , sadly , male as well . so , if you want ""fair"" in terms of exploitation , you got it . i cannot recommend this trash to anyone . it's not even the good bad movie . it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then , if you are making your way through the list , leave this for the very last . if you watch it first , you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list , which is certainly not true .",0,2
"it was everything this is not : it had pace , pop , and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery . it also had a decent script . this one had me scratching my head . if farrah is not really ""serious"" about a career , why does she have a manager ( and why is he wasting his time ) ? if kate and barney are ""artists , "" why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows ( like the ""brady bunch"" movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare , only to find himself on bb ) ? they were not industry names , but they were not exactly starving , either . and while they got the history right ( the poster was released before farrah got the show ) , silverman rejecting pitches for ""funniest home videos"" and ""american idol"" and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he will create a show for her obviously did not happen . what bothered me was how spelling's role is distorted . he's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither . and how he ""comes up"" with the ""idea"" for ca was is laughable ! how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah's oral contract when the others were signed ? and why did not farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva , but because majors wanted her to ? this is why , when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the ""bad girl"" ( like suzanne somers ) , it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the ""three's company"" pic delivered .",0,2

"la coda dello scorpione ( a . k . a . case of the scorpion's tail ) was director sergio martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh . this is the quintessential giallo , featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love . twisty plot , beautiful girls , black gloves , sharp blades , and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation . a group of gialli favorites , both in front of and behind the camera , work to make this one of the best non-argento gialli around . there's the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director , giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer , bruno nicolai creating the music , and a host of giallo stars and starlets , such as george hilton , character actor luigi pistilli , and the fetching anita strindberg . with all this talent behind it , does scorpione deliver ? you bet . the film works on many different levels . it's a thrilling murder mystery , a tense and violent horror film , and a suspenseful thriller . all in all one of the best gialli around . martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli . at some points in the film , he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach . for example , there is a direct rip-off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door , that actually outdoes argento's flick . are there any problems with the flick ? hmmm . . . only minor ones . first , any scenes that are not following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore . but just before you fall asleep , the killer will pop out of nowhere and you will be right back in the swing of things . also , towards the end , the twists get a little too bizarre . i mean , what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve ? if you do not play close attention to the dialogue , you could easily become lost with the twisting , weaving storyline . but these minor quibbles aside , la coda dello scorpione is a tense , suspenseful , classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans . seek it out !",1,9

"to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible . every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images , through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero , but every frame is real . the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york . jules ( 28 ) and gideon ( 31 ) naudet ( pronounced ""nau-day"" ) want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters , beginning with a ""newbie"" from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter . seeking the help of their close friend , actor james hanlon ( 36 ) , an actor and firefighter at station 1 , engine 7 , the naudets sift through the ""probies"" at the academy and find one , tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on . tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family . firefighters have a superstition about ""probies . "" it is that they are either ""white clouds"" or ""black clouds , "" meaning that with the latter , all kinds of fires follow the ""probie . "" the former means that very little fire activity follows , but one day , there will be the mother of all fires . tony is a ""white cloud . "" after some initial growing pains , tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet . then the unthinkable occurs . . . . september 11 , 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street . because jules has had little camera experience , gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief , t . k . pfeiffer . arriving at about 8 : 42 , the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate . then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene , and as jules pans upwards , we see the first strike of the day . american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade . pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center . once there , jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower . pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him . once inside , the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives . gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area . once there , he captures the impact of the second plane , united airlines flight 175 , with 2 world trade . he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers . watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable , gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan . inside tower one , jules records the last view the world , or loved ones will have of their sons , fathers , uncles , grandfathers , husbands , boyfriends , friends as one by one , each firefighter , carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped . jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother , kevin , as he leaves to do his selfless duty . also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones , sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke . but jules is respectful , never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment . . . the money shot . his work is professional through his baptism of fire . he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building . then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken : father michael judd , the chaplain for the fire department . then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two , tower one begins its structural collapse . what results is a breathtakingly , poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day . not knowing if either is alive , each fearing the worst . as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse , they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back . and in one moment of overwhelming emotion , jules and gideon are reunited . as jules cries on his brother's shoulder , gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject . there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos , who left the station with a former chief , is believed to have been lost . . . but returns to the fold , this ""probie"" has proven himself . shown with only three interruptions , 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking . it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds . the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject . in lesser hands , the tendency would be toward the sensational , but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion . narrated by hanlon , we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 . robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre , restrained way . he never seeks the camera for his own glory , rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see . i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special . chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings , they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished . this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is . it is not about dribbling a basketball , or selling an album of hate lyrics . . . 9/11 is about humanity at its best . heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .",1,10

"late , great grade z drive-in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci-fi soft-core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw-dropping stupidity . in the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother-like impotent bumbling idiot the controller ( an amusingly goofy erwin fuller ) . however , sweet'n'sexy cinderella ( radiant blonde cutie pie catherine erhardt ) remains determined to change things for the better . with the help of her effeminate fairy godfather ( a flamboyantly campy jay b . larson ) , cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud tom prince ( the dorky vaughn armstrong ) and teaching everyone that making love is a positive , pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity . adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all-thumbs incompetence , staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair . the uproariously abysmal ""we all need love"" number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel; ditto the equally abominable ""mechnical man"" routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots . louis horvarth's crude , static cinematography , the tacky plastic miniatures , sparky sugerman's groovy throbbing disco score , the copious gratuitous nudity ( ravishing brunette hottie sherri coyle warrants special praise in this particular department ) , the brain-numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor ( roscoe the robot law enforcer is especially irritating ) , and the uniformly terrible performances ( renee harmon's outrageously hammy portrayal of cinderella's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here ) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy .",1,8

"this movie ( and yes , it is a movie - it was shot as a two-parter , but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours ) is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema . a very well-mannered , and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it , the film is a faithful adaptation of the long-banned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov . the sets are flawless , and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia , adding a feel of authenticity where a late-80s washed-out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film . i will not say much about the plot , which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself , but the performances are true oscar material; special mentions go out to e . evstigneev , who plays the old professor with such presence , gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture , he ends up stealing every scene he is in . the second , of course , is creature/sharikov , who , played to horrifying perfection by v . tolokonnikov , is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter , because not only does he exist in real life - entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history , with all that ensues . while it is a socio political allegory , it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor , albeit dark - there are many outright comedies which have not made me laugh as much as this film . what's more , when laughing at this movie , the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement , which is always a plus . there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie - the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual/bourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the ""enlightened"" characters . but that is a minor quibble . sadly , this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies . it's a crying shame that one of the all-round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated ( which should not be incredibly hard - though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation , the film's main themes should be accessible to all ) . while we are waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition , i'm considering creating english subtitles myself . will see how that works out .",1,10

"i bought this a year or more ago for $2 ( yep , $2 ) , left it on the shelf for ages , now watching dvds while holed up with a cold . this is a haunting movie . brilliant performances by all involved , especially the 6yo boy ( about the only smiles you get in this movie ) . plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever , grosse pointe blank , but obviously that is lighthearted , this is heavy hearted . as a psychologist , a clinical and forensic psychologist , a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed . scary stuff ! brilliant work all round . pete",1,9
"i think i read this someplace : joe johnston ( director of the film and also one of the guys who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film ) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie , ""rocket boys"" ( i guess ) was lacking something . one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words ( ie : you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words ) i think the technical term is an ""anagram"" anyway , they typed in ""rocket boys"" and sure enough what comes back is ""october sky"" . they were shocked to say the least . the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik . at first homer jr did not like the idea , but he warmed up to it after the ""movie poster paperback novel"" came out and took off .",1,10
"in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often . the plot is unrealistically convoluted , the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check . once again he has assembled an impressive cast ( like woody allen , everyone wants to work with altman ) that this time around to the letter is miscast . but that is only part of the problem . kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad . with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that is not enough there is a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale . branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent . running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he is blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . hipster bob downey jr . is every bit as bad as a p . i . but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . the female leads ( embeth davidtz , darryl hannah , famkhee jansen ) are lean leggy and unemotive . even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos ( vernon jordan ) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have . in addition to paying little attention to his actors , altman's mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless , his action scenes comic book . it lacks his offbeat touches and observations ( he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia ) that make a well done altman so unique . unfortunately , gingerbread man is altman at his worst , even if the pay is the same .",0,3
"it's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many people's minds . and now , god knows why , she is in the game again . ""basic instinct 2"" is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica ""basic instinct"" featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas . however , fans of the original might not even get close to this one , since ""instinct 2"" is painful film-making , as the mediocre director michael caton-jones assassinates the legacy of the first film . the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning . catherine tramell ( sharon stone , trying to look forcefully sexy ) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder . a psychiatrist ( a horrible david morrisey ) is appointed to examine her , but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction . and there it is , without no further explanations , the basic force that moves this ""instinct"" . nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy , c-class erotic film . sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn-off . part of it because of the amateurish writing , the careless direction , and terrifyingly low chemistry . the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality ( a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this would not be rated nc-17 ) than the first entrance in the series . ""instinct"" is a compelling torture . to top it off , everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film . the acting here is really bad . sharon stone has some highlights , but here , she gets extremely obnoxious . david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life , and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie- confused and aroused . ""instinct 2"" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series , that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well . paul verhoeven , how i miss you . . . . ""basic instinct 2"" never sounded like a good movie , and , indeed , it is not . some films should never get out of paper , and that is the feeling you get after watching this . now , it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out , and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this . . . . . . -----3/10",0,3
"what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless ! ""wizards of the lost kingdom"" is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/sword-and-sorcery adventure that does not have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films . writer ed naha and hector olivera ( who ? ) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters , but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically . in order to make a fantasy-adventure you need : one super- evil villain ( preferably with a black cape ) , one young hero in training , one lone warrior , one amiable type of furry pet , one wise midget living in the woods ( optional ) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons , enslaved dwarfs , and winged gargoyles to serve as filler . the story is phenomenal and so original , with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king . simon wants to go back and save the people , but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape . simon befriends lone warrior kor ( the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check ) , who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals , dangerous encounters and magical showdowns . admittedly it does not even sound too bad thus far , but that is merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details . simon has a best friend named gulfax , for example . gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible . the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the ""plot"" and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content . simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph , kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there is the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave' where you can only sing your way out of . but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors . simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors , hoping they will assist them in their battle , but the rotting corpses only take a few steps , complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves . that's it ! so much for the zombie sub plot ! best sequence ever ! i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs , but you get the idea . ""wizards of the lost kingdom"" is a tremendously messed-up ""so-bad-it is-good"" film . word of advice : do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone . invite friends , preferably the dope-headed types with a wicked sense of humor , and watch it in group . it will be a night to remember",0,2
"john scott ( john wayne ) and partner kansas charlie ( eddy chandler ) are trail buddies who make their way to the rattlesnake gulch rodeo . scott is a pretty fair contestant , but finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter , he will have to collect his winnings at gunpoint . quite coincidentally , bandits pete ( al ferguson ) and jim ( paul fix ) decide they would like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter farnsworth ( henry hall ) , and make it look like scott and kansas charlie are the killers . wayne and chandler use a running gag in the film where they are about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities . each time chandler takes a wild swing , wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly . if you are very attentive , there is a neat lipton's tea ad in one of the scenes in which scott's love interest anne ( mary kornman ) appears . later on in the film , the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery . having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways , bad guy jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff , but pete shoots him down . while being patched up , jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister anne . in an unbelievable scene , anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff . ""the desert trail"" is one of the blander john wayne westerns from lone star productions during this era . noticeably absent are george ""gabby"" hayes and yakima canutt , one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters . if you are a john wayne fan though , you will have to see it once , but that will probably be enough .",0,4
"""the college girl murders"" is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace and generally my first real acquaintance with ""krimi"" films in general and i can say that i'm moderately impressed . this stuff is really entertaining , although i never would have expected it to be so goofy ! the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot , with a healthy dose of humor , flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings . there's some james bond type of evil mastermind who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison . there's also a villainous monk with a whip , dressed like a communist kkk member , getting rid of the leftover characters , like overly curious teachers and such , as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach . seriously , if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy , i would have purchased a whole collection of them already . the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end , and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow , but i do not care because it was sublime entertainment . even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time . it's like a variant on the italian giallo , but with slapstick elements .",1,7
"this is a funny film . it has all the usual disney components ( music , great range of characters , story , appeal ) , entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""antz"" and ""price of egypt"" . the characters work really well , and have a strong appeal , and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers . the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format , which adds to the cinema experience . call me crazy , but i have seen the film three times , and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend . many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed . i work in a multiplex , and i can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction . see it , and do not be put off because it is animated . you are sure to enjoy this movie , and make sure you stay for the end credits ! the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film , which is packed with laughs throughout .",1,9
"i do not pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello , but i've never witnessed a performance of the play , on film or on stage , wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity . according to the biographical notes , fishburne never received any professional training as an actor . perhaps this explains why his acting , in this beautifully edited film , comes over as so believable and so powerful . instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles , fishburne's portrayal is focused more on othello's love for his wife , and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal , than on violence and vengeance . in a word , the performance is understated , and made far more impressive by fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been . the acting throughout is superb , and the ( abridged ) speeches gain grace from their light editing . ( even shakesspeare , after all , can be improved upon , now and again -- and if that be treason , make the most of it !",1,9

"bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly does not follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts . the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin that is virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces . but there is still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you have grown to expect . just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family , mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director . looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature . but despite fairly good distribution across the globe , the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market . nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert , which as i'm sure you will agree is hardly the most exciting location . with that said though , i must admit that there is certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly . four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way . chris ( jennifer mcallister ) and her boyfriend greg ( kenny johnson ) meet up with amusing new age hippies trip ( kevin mcparland ) and mary ( nicole anton ) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness . greg's older brother kyle ( todd schaefer ) and his buxom girlfriend bambi ( laura albert ) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave . kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze something that kyle does not seem too keen to forget . sound like a motive for a massacre ? well what did you expect ? before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve . will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel ? i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature . i do not even know if director bill crain is aka william crain the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others . mirage certainly does not appear on his official filmography , so your guess is as good as mine . judging by the credible work behind the camera , i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience . the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain , and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it is necessary . r . christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome , and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating . a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre . one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade , while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck ! there's also some black humor that is surely unintentional . we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters . but when he is revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey , i did not quite know what to expect . thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically . there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast . the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b . g . steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse . the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully does not come at the cost of thespian potential . the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation , which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs . watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it is freakiest . mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite . when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck , you have to say that they did a damn good job . the flaws are numerous , but never detract credibility from the net result . unfortunately you have probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy . if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store , then make sure you pick it up . recommended .",1,7

"as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser , i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released . sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again , but it was no better the second time . mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer , but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester . the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here . to me , the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong . the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts , but they are adventure novels . there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all , he is involved in dangerous situations . this is conveyed in the novels , but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style . it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book . when i first read that the book was to be filmed , the article said that the film was to star oliver reed . i rejoiced , as reed to me was the epitome of flashman . how i would have loved to see him in the role . malcolm mcdowell is a good actor , but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books ( too scrawny looking ! flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow ) . neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck . what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy . the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet ( tom bell ) . a great shame , as the production values , costumes , sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell . possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is , as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom' , adapted by mr fraser , worked quite well . perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen .",0,4

"in the title i write that the story is ludicrous . below i'll elaborate and tell you why it , in my humble opinion , ruins this movie . gere and danes are doing their jobs , and while it is not their best work , it is quite ok . the rest of the cast , though , is doing a really poor job . mind you , this is not entirely the actors fault . the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth . all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth , or the character is such a clich that it does not matter how hard the actors try . the director has a bit of a se7en complex , but looking merely at the direction , i think he does an ok job . but the story . this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways . first of all it is a bad movie script . the characters are shallow ( except for gere's and danes' characters ) , the villains are clich s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable . besides this , the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years . it's the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals , regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them . it's also the kind of movie that says , albeit only between the lines , that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial , judge or jury . and of course , according to the movie , everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance . so , if you are going to film school and need an example of a bad script , or if you are writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost . see it . for everyone else , i recommend another movie .",0,2

"this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest , in my opinion . a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her . and at this point , i will say that these films are not real ! they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible . the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases . for example , when they kick the girl in the floor , we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl ! and how stupid this looks ! the sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense . other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl , the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours , the ripping off of fingernails , worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body , the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig , although it is not as bloody as the next part , flowers of flesh and blood , which tries to be as shocking as possible . guinea pig : devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . this is still ( of course ) faked s ( n/t ) uff , the only difference to genuine ""snuff film"" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film . i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive . they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . i watched this as a curiosity ( as the other parts in the series ) and now i know how insignificant trash these are . they work only in shock level and that is not too valuable cinematic achievement . devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole ( guinea pig 4 ) is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen . so these are pretty extreme in my book , but that is all they are .",0,1

"it's hard to top this movie in several ways . everything works really well here; the casting , acting , script , and cinematography are all first-rate . for the moviegoer , it is a moving , violent story of love and human redemption . for the film critic , there is plenty of sharp technique and technical merit . there are some tactical blunders , and as has been discussed on the boards , the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle . however , i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent's pragmatic approach , creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences . like jesus himself , creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice , whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not . in any case , i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice , which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent . in any case , this film is very much worth watching if you are at all attracted to the genre . an excellent soundtrack , great writing , flawless casting , and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 ( or better ) film .",1,9
"an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time , this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon . i remember this very well from my childhood , it was funny and sad and very beautiful . well it starts out a bit dark , a dog who escaped the pound , and gets killed by an old friend , ends up in heaven , and comes back . but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals . some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons , like the dream sequence of charlie , but everything else was okay , and the songs were fair . a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise , i just love that guy , ahehehe . and judith barsi of jaws the revenge , may god rest her soul , poor girl , she did not deserve to die , but she is in heaven now , all good people go to heaven . overall this is a very good animated movie , a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame . recommended for the whole family . and know this , if you have the original video of this , you will find after the movie , dom deluise has a very important and special message , gotta love that guy , ahehehe .",1,8
"while the original 1932 version , with preston foster , was good , there is no remake more worthy than this 1959 one , or more impossible to find anywhere , just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that . never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant , or a script more thought-provoking , as well as an improvement upon the original . many years after the last of my several viewings of this film , in 1970 , i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he would made to death row , and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he would felt with people in similar circumstances . the article was about as short as the main character here , and did not cover much , other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized , even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here . . . . . one of my main problems with capital punishment is that , of course , it is not evenly , impartially applied , just as many innocent people are far-too-carelessly , thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate . another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough , or , for that matter , even publicly enough ! the bible makes a special point , in such cases , about one of the more important purposes of such , as a deterrent , being ineffectually obscured , minus , not only a public viewing , but also the direct participation of all ! as for those who claim to prove , statistically , that such is not an effective deterrent ? in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data , i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking . however , i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall , in the apostle , had been punished at all , for his particular ""crime , "" or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a ""temporary insanity"" defense , as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case . . . . in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he would recounted , and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate , i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature . i do not know exactly when he would become the professing christian he now makes it a special point , whenever possible , to emphasize that he is; but , as anybody should be well-aware , this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood , when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye . however , i have no particular bone of contention concerning that , per se , just as there is no doubt , scripturally speaking , that not all , and perhaps not even most , shall be spared the same ultimate fate , at the hands of the lord himself , as a result of his sacrifice on the cross . however , there is a problem , for me , about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment; for , contrary to the lord himself , who would love to see everybody saved ( ezekiel 18 : 32 ) ( ii peter 3 : 9 ) , they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn ! . . . what most people , on either side of this superlatively ever-burning issue , cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate , is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard . the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged , at least by any strictly human reckoning . yet , regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is , there can be no doubt that anything short of it , or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation , falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth . indeed , i've seen the most blood-curdling thirst for the same come out , self-contradictorily enough , on far-too-many occasions , whenever the categorically anti-death penalty advocates are confronted , even in the most rationally well-balanced ways , with the fact that , although the lord died for everybody , not all are thereby going to be saved . after-all , in order to receive absolution , one must , to repeat the same term , reach out and receive it , that is , repent ( luke 13 : 3-5 ) . could anything make more sense ? . . . but , then , what about the lord's command to forgive , even in the case of one's enemies , of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation ? one of the far-too-prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality , as popularly misinterpreted , is the way it obscuringly over-simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness . the act of forgiveness does not , in itself , mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven . when one takes a clearly sober , rationally well-balanced view here , from the perspective of god's own attitude , all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way , seeing the light , and being granted mercy . this attitude is , of course , the very opposite of , say , that of jonah , who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance . jonah did not want them to repent , but vindictively desired that they be destroyed . how self-righteously , cold-bloodedly like unto most professing christians he was , save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most ! i envy jonah almost as much as he would me ! however , minus the repentance of the one being forgiven , any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good . in such a case , the only one to benefit is the real christian himself !",1,10

". . . but it is certainly not without merit . already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories , creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations , and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue . ( no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges . ) the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise , the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing . the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon , and the ending is thoroughly predictable . frank capra does this sort of thing much better . if you are new to preston sturges , check out ""the lady eve"" or ""sullivan's travels"" or ""the miracle of morgan's creek"" first . if you have seen these already , then go ahead and watch this one .",0,2
"airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens ( james stewart ) who is flying them & a bunch of vip's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum , also on board is stevens daughter julie ( kathleen quinlan ) & her son . the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot chambers ( robert foxworth ) & his two accomplice's banker ( monte markham ) & wilson ( michael pataki ) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas , they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle . with air in short supply , water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out . . . also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport ( 1970 ) was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like it is predecessors i cannot say airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best , just . it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing ( did not he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it is a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's , dull dialogue , lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there is not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . even when the navy become involved things do not pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there is just something lacking here . george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . the home video & theatrical version of airport '77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport '77 . as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are not great either . along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award's hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that is a little harsh . the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . the acting is not great , two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this , one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail , also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too . airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does not help though & a film about a sunken plane just should not be this boring or lethargic . followed by the concorde . . . airport '79 ( 1979 ) .",0,4

"the best of the seven sam fuller movies that i've seen ( including park row , run of the arrow , verboten ! , shock corridor , the naked kiss , the big red one , and this film ) , pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs . it represents fuller at his most controlled . i like him when he is out of control , of course , but nearly everything in pickup is perfect . the film is absolutely beautiful . richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies . jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend , played by richard kiley . peters is forced to find widmark and get it back . she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter . widmark and peters are attracted to each other , which changes peters loyalties ( that , and the fact that she learns she is working for communists; the cold war stuff is really interesting ) . the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable , but it is not so bad that it harms the film ( unlike fuller's previous film , park row ) . richard widmark is great . this must be one of his best roles , but i'm not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure . thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance . her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance , and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema . i will never forget that . 10/10 .",1,10

"as for many on here i cannot help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood , i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters . to class this work of art as a ""cartoon"" could never do talespin justice , in fact it is an insult to class it as a ""cartoon"" , talespin is an animation and nothing less , it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date , when disney ""pulled"" it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since . i'll take a moment to explain , from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck , disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since , they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey's for the story's , i could not have my children watching the mind-numbing ""cartoons"" they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it , i could not let that happen , which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a harddrive so one day my children could not be corrupted by the ""cartoon crap"" of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin . talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it is depth , charm , wit , compassion , emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today , do you see any of that content in say ""ed , edd and eddie or anything else you can think of ? , the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso . the next time you watch an episode of talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation , even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again , the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted , even the vehicles are true to life , ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail . the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the ""deliberate mistakes"" or ""intended mistakes"" in each episode and some have two , for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's ""you're up to something baloo"" and baloo replies ""who , me ! , i'm as innocent as a schoolboy"" take a look into rebecca's eyes , i will not spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time . everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100% correct , i have nothing else to add that others have not said already on here , disney , wake up and smell the coffee , you have been asleep for over a decade , stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing ""cartoons"" , we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible .",1,10
"picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says ""lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public ( also black ) in the street and ask him if he is black , then walk away"" . the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode . more laughter . now if you think the premise is funny , and the show contains many such types of situation , you will enjoy this show . for the rest , use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry . those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny . another example of the humor in the show , a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier . marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers ? i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers , divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all .",0,1
"there are three movies with this animation style that i fondly remember from my youth . this movie , ""the last unicorn , "" ""flight of dragons"" and ""the hobbit . "" i own copies of both ""dragons"" and ""the hobbit"" ( both excellent ) and i had not seen ""the last unicorn"" in more than a decade . that was until today and now i wish i had not . what bothered me the most was the script . it was incredibly choppy and often inane . things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation . we're not just talking about little things here either; we are talking about key plot points ! the story itself is not that great to begin with , but it could have worked had the script been decent . not even close . on top of that the music was awful ! i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces , but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball . this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day , but it just got cut . i do not think i could ever sit through that crap fest again . disappointed is putting it mildly .",0,2
"i've always liked fred macmurray , and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch . pair these two major and attractive stars together , add top supporting players like jean dixon , anthony quinn , dorothy lamour and charles butterworth , give them a romantic script , team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you get a mediocre movie experience . skid johnson ( fred ) and maggie ( carole ) ""meet cute"" during her visit to the panama canal , and spend the next few weeks falling in love . skid's a great trumpeter , so he embarks on a musical career , which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall . during his climb to musical stardom , he neglects maggie , who later inspires him to start over after he is hit rock bottom . ah , yes it is the true hollywood happy ending , which comes none too soon . stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success , but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it is difficult to watch at times . the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever , and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york . fred and carole try their best , but the tired script and s-l-o-w direction just do not give them a chance . even the final scene , in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment , just does not ring true . this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard . however , i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours .",0,4

"the most interesting thing about miryang ( secret sunshine ) is the actors . jeon do-yeon , as lee shin-ae , the main character , is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident , and who leaves seoul to live in miryang , which was his home town , with her young son . jeon's face is very changeable . she is girlish , flirtatious , elegant , aged and sad , desperate and joyous , with it and terribly isolated by turns , and it is all in her face . the film also stars song kang-ho as kim , a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into miryang , who happens to run a garage in town , and who follows her around all the time thereafter , despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions . song is the biggest star in korea right now , renowned for his work with park chan-wook and bong joon-ho ( sympathy for mr . vengeance; memories of murder and the host ) . and yet here he plays a throwaway character , almost a forgotten man . but of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing . he is the essential ballast to keep jeon's character from floating away . lee shin-ae is a piano teacher . she comes to the new town , which is a neutral place , a kind of poor-man's seoul , a town ""just like anywhere else , "" as kim says ( just as he is in a way just like anyone else ) . her little boy is sprightly , as little boys are , but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too . his father used to snore , and when he misses him he lies awake , pretending to snore . he goes to school , and shin-ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers . there is a sense of place in the film , even though the place is in a sense ""anywhere . "" people speak in the local dialect , and everyone knows everything , and shin-ae's seoul origin is immediately noticed . is life really harsher here , away from the big city and its sophistication ? shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is in . something terrible happens . and shin-ae does not necessarily deal with it in the best possible way . but it happens and she must face the consequences . but she cannot . she goes to pieces . a perpetrator is caught , but that is no consolation . eventually she becomes so despairing , she relents and goes to a born-again christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend . she finds peace and release with this . but when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so , that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again . she becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion . and it gets worse than that . jeon do-yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role . lee chang-dong may be a very good director . if an actor of the stature of song kang-ho expresses enormous admiration for him , that is convincing . according to scott foundas of la weekly , lee's first three films , green fish ( 1997 ) , peppermint candy ( 2000 ) and oasis ( 2002 ) have marked him out as ""one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance . "" but this is not as successful a film as those of other korean directors whose work i've seen , such as yong sang-soo , bong joon-ho , and the prodigiously , almost perversely gifted park chan-wook . it may indeed begin as foundas says as a kind of ""asiatic alice doesn't live here anymore"" and then ""abruptly and without warning"" turns into ""something of a thriller , and some time after that a nearly bressonian study in human suffering . "" but that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out , with no sense of an ending . there are also weaknesses in the action . shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son , and makes bad choices all along . if she is destined for madness like betty in jean-jacques beineix's betty blue , which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices , that is not something that is properly developed . this is an interesting film , certainly a disturbing one , but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied , after putting one through an emotional wringer . an official selection of the new york film festival presented at lincoln center , 2007 an event that has done right by korean filmmakers in the recent past .",1,7
"love rosario dawson , think she is one of the finest actresses of the modern era . descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else . it's the consistent undertone in everything in the film . the dialog is flat , the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided . the only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and rosario's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again . pitching this as a rape classic is not appropriate , and that is probably why so many people do not enjoy the film . the standard 'rape' audience would not particularly like this film , and maybe that is the point ? the film asks more questions than it answers , and it does confront it is target audience , whether they like it or not . there's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film does not slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be , all the wrong reasons . descent is a good film which imho is severely under-rated .",1,8

"where was this film when i was a kid ? after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather . tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone . grandfather is only ""here"" every third day . moms never really home . the kids always are picking on the poor kid . during a village festival tadashi is chosen the ""kirin rider"" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice . little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world . okay that was the easy part . now comes the hard part , trying to explain the film . this is a great kids film . no this is a great film , flawed , ( very flawed ? ) but a great film none the less . it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero . watching it i felt i was reading a great book , and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book . i loved that the film does not follow a normal path . things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication , one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep . there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it ( which is typical miike ) certainly its a takashi miike film . that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching , scary and funny all at the same time . no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time , or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next . i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful , that does not shy away from being scary , i mean really scary , especially for kids . this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is . this a dark grimms tale with humor . my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i could not believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world , then i realized who was making the movie . hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images . its also operating on more than one level . the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk . its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters . one of the yokai ( spirits ) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed . you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do . its a wild concept , but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level . ( there are a good many riffs and references to other movies , tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them , though many parents will ) and of course there are the monsters . they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between . frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen . its way cool and it works . one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal , it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head . ( acceptance is also easier if you have ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters ) i mentioned flaws , and there are a few . the effects are uneven , some of the sudden turns are a bit odd ( even if understandable ) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film . . none of them truly hurt the film over all , however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie . i really loved this movie . i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time .

"this is just plain bad . sometimes remakes , even if they stray from the original , are good on their own . they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable . this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be . this was not any good even standing on it is own . viggo mortenson is a top-notch actor , but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired . the original ""vanishing point"" was such a thrilling , psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all , and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever . this was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making , stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience . basically , they see us as a bunch of idiots . it's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film , and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily . the manipulative plot devices , the ""make-it-obvious-so-they-do not-miss-the-point"" aspects , ridiculous dialogue , stereotyped characters , amateurish direction . . . this is plain bad . . . .",0,1
"preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings , assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered . film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood , with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses ( . . looking for a way up the ladder ) and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight . brian krause , who i thought was dreadful , overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced , portrays the loud , temperamental director who does not like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer , alison ( . . played by dahlia salem ) seem to be taking over the production . andrew moxham is paul parsons , who is the brother of a victim from the first film . the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it is worth . nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty , with stanley as clever as ever , using his brains to commandeer a film production , killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work , letting no one stand in his way . . that is until alison realizes who stanley really is . alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject . . what motivated stanley to kill , why would he do such a thing , and what led such a man down this dark path ? the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller . of course , you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley , with a really ridiculous , unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate ( . . quite a hard pill to swallow ) . unlike the first film , which was photographed with sophisticated polish , director po-chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed ( . . such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles , slow-motion in a sepia color , and several instances which are captured on video ) and rather annoy instead of impress . this sequel , to me , just was not on target as much as the original , with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious .",0,4
"""the bourne ultimatum"" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne ( matt damon , absolutely superb ) tracks down the masterminds behind the cia black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity . a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the ""man behind the curtain"" is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen ( excellent ) and julia stiles ( non-existent ) . like the second entry in the series , i wished paul greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime . however , that being said , it is a perfect way to capture the tense , claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up . part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities . the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic . it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time , but i'll be damned if it is not a blast to watch them get there . with the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente , the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles , but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything . still , this can be forgiven , for unlike the ""identity"" and the ""supremacy"" , this ""ultimatum"" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bourne's past . it's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series , and if they have any good sense , and damon gets his wish , this will be the perfect end to it .",1,8

"in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice . michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock , central australia , that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no-one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby , and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain's trial was over before it began . lindy never proved her innocence , so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her , yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement ? from where we are , how could we possibly presume to know ? unless there was absolute proof , and no reasonable doubt whatsoever , the chamberlains should have been acquitted . fred schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson's novel , that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock . schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation , hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay ! his screenplay , co-written with robert caswell , vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred . the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost , but not quite , spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart , and he starts to question his christianity . his , as was streep's , is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent , with some of australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part . technically the film is brilliant too , with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour ( especially the rock ) . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged , while bruce smeaton provides a telling score . for all aussies this is a must see , a shocking look in the mirror if you will , at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served , and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said : ""i do not think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people . "" saturday , may 20 , 1995 - video even on return viewings fred schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains , who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980 , is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving . schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson's novel to the screen , telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain , whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down . amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby , and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media , and with the australian people determined she be put away , lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour , even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence . meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome , and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent , though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress was not cast in the role , but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill , outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes , while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support . editing from jill bilcock is very timely , ian baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton's music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians . sunday , june 15 , 1996 - video",1,9
"john cassavetes' ""opening night"" is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination , fascinating because it never ceases surprising us . with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes , anyone who appreciates characters will not be able to take their eyes off the screen . the story of an unstable actress , myrtle gordon , ( gena rowlands ) trying to put herself together for a play , fighting her demons; ""opening night"" is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world . all of cassavetes' characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater; so half of the film takes place on a stage , either where the performers do their job or at backstage , where producers and writers and directors do their job . cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience , but the audience in the cinema . because there is another audience , in the theater of the film , that does not know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance . and that is essentially what it is; it is just that the audience in the theater does not get to see 'backstage' the way we do . they do not experience gena rowlands' exuberance before she goes out to that stage , but most importantly; they do not know the reasons why she acts the way she does . i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor . myrtle ( rowland ) says she is an actress and that is the only thing she knows how to do; and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer , it would be really difficult to tell when he is saying the truth because i would know he is an actor and he can fake anything at any time . a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her through we suspect if she is being real; the rest of the characters suspect too . there is the writer , sarah ( joan blondell ) , who cannot understand why myrtle does not understand the character she is written for her . there's the director , manny ( ben gazzara ) , who cannot accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it; the producer david ( paul stewart ) who does not know where to stand and myrtle's co-star maurice ( cassavetes himself ) , who cannot deal with the love they have for each other . when she witnesses the death of a teenager , a fan; all of this comes together and affects myrtle , but no one knows if her delusions are for real . they do not say anything because they do not want to upset her , but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts . at times , we can tell that everyone has had it . during these moments , cassavetes' brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage; and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them . here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking , just like cassavetes' way of making cinema . and in this aspect , the performances are more important here than in ""shadows"" , because the characters are involved in a bigger picture; a bigger story that steps out of the trivial . but in another aspect , the actual way of making cinema , this movie is no different from ""shadows"" . there's a beautiful thing in the way al ruban's camera shoots the characters . when someone's talking , the camera does not focus on him , it shoots the person who is listening; so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one's saying . sometimes they do not care , sometimes they are happy , sometimes devastated . improvisation might still be there , though , among all these wonderful performances . near the end , there is an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking , non-stop . whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder . we have just got to watch; and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it shows it does not get more natural than that .",1,9
this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it is watchable and rather funny . i do not think the film-makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality . it's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow ( as it is the middle of winter ) . he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it is own . this film is really stupid but it is funny . the killings are hilarious . i would not advise you to go and buy it ( like i did -the cover looked good ! ) but if it happens to be on tv one night and you are up for a laugh then stick it on .,0,3

"over the years i've seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies , and every one holds the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley , the entertainment level is at a low . sure , the action sequences were amusing , but that was pretty much it . seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like; under siege , under siege 2 , and executive decision ( at least on the action standpoint ) , but during the past ten years , these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications . on the more positive side , the movie did make good use of time , like some of the action sequences and use of wit . just when the movie seemed to just drag on , a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter . i honestly believe that more of segal's movies would do better if he was not the only one that fans recognize in the movie . supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing , and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses , maybe the movie will get more popular results .",0,3

( main exception would be hilary duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star , need i say name ( s ) ? ) . at its core the feature is an anti-globalization gig , period . the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance . joan has a line at one point that goes like this : ""and here we have a book written by you know who , about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dad"" . priceless ) ) ) the sister and brother cusacks play good together as always , same as in ""grosse pointeblank"" i would say a bit more ""mature"" . marisa tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to ""impress"" us ( like she did recently in ""before the devil knows you're dead"" ) , but instead she has a very serious role , and manages to pull it off quiet well . many critics do not get it ( can not do so , or do not want to ) . this is not a ""regular"" movie but more of a comic documentary . this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars , or have ""visuals"" sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest ""hdtv experience"" tv sets . . . i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re-views because is not ""artistic"" , while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being ""balanced"" apparently and ""engaging"" . makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys . . . i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america . as i mentioned before , it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by ""special interests"" groups . . . having the ""regular"" american soldier wearing the ""tamerlane"" corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is , or will be soon the way things go so far . some priceless shots : upon ""liberation"" , the country gets invaded commercial advertisements; a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather ""news"" ( ""anything is got to be better then this x-box bullocks"" ) ) ) ; soldiers dealing with their ""frustration""; overall , i do not recommend this to ""conservatives"" or ""hard core"" patriots of some kind or another . this feature is not made to reach to the ""minds of souls"" of the people ( as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so ) . instead it contains a message well defined for realists , and towards some ideological goals apparently ""always"" short of realizing .",1,10
"utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out . why was he still driving a car ? why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one ? this question has not occurred to the writers . the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver . an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure , and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale . are police psychologists so easily taken in ? deadful writing that the actors do their best with , but they are doomed to failure . this is on a par with a harlequin romance . don't waste your time watching this one unless that is what you are aiming for .",0,1

"wow , this film was just bloody horrid . so bad in fact that even though i did not pay to see it , i still wanted my money back . the film is about nothing intelligible . it's a mish-mash of sci-fi cliche is that were done better by much more skilled film makers . the performances , especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way . speaking of ed wood , he would be proud of the character's dialogue . it's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor . on top of that , it does not make sense , nor does the plot , or lackthereof . the visual effects are okay , but not enough to go ""oh wow , that is cool"" and they just seem to be thrown in to ""be cool"" rather than be a good plot device . the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood . again , it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to ""be cool"" . which brings me to my final point . perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot , story and dialogue instead of trying to ""be cool"" , he would not have made such a dorky cliche' of a short film .",0,1
"watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema . i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me , the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience . it is one of those films that has stayed with me , and i continue to ponder and think about it . surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements ? which include : sidney lumet's comeback movie , the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling , the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well , the masterly direction , the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women , the under-presented , but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance , and , of course , the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie . phew ! surely a masterful film . so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd - only to find no commentary , no behind-the-scenes , no interviews , no extras . hey - distributors - sort it out !",1,10
"i totally got drawn into this and could not wait for each episode . the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest . the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end . we could not hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary's part in the whole thing was ? why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it ? having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion . i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either . very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ? ? ? ?",1,8
"i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago . it came and went with little fanfare , but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage . ( the story , while nice , is really incidental . if you actually thought about it , there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life . ) i just saw it again tonight , here in the states , on dvd . again , i gather it has very limited distribution . blockbusters only had one copy of it , and i do not recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland . seen on my tv , the photography is not as breathtaking , though it is still very beautiful . the wildlife footage is still fascinating . the story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around , when you know where it is headed . still , as i said , the story is incidental . it's a beautiful film to watch , and if you like wildlife footage , you should find this fascinating .",1,7
"this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies : although his majesty , mr . kinski , is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger , starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer' , you have young eddi arendt in his best ( and just as well typical ) role ever - the cool , sophisticated british butler - and you have ( not so young anymore ) lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic ( and thus : highly entertaining ) police investigator . furthermore you will get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask ( hence the movie's title ! ) , you will get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack , classic b-movie action scenes , partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives ( please remind the time of its origin ! ) , yelling scream queens , and on and on . . . all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness - highly recommended ! !",1,8
"jeff lowell has written & directed 'over her dead body' poorly . the idea is first of all , is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake . minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film . eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance . paul rudd looks jaded and least interested . lake bell is a complete miscast . she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance . jason biggs is wasted , so is lindsay sloane . i expected entertainment more from this film . sadly , i did not get entertained .",0,4
"zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats . i do not typically go for military/war movies , but this was worth my time . it was serious , but it was also humorous . beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest . no matter what , you know that he is got your back . zane's character developed throughout the film . he was not just a suit , he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun . the ending through me a little though . it did not really go with the action throughout the film , but i'm glad that i saw it , nonetheless . it's worth checking out .",1,7
"this film speaks a universal language; one can relate it to the self , community , society or the wider world . it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership . the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction , the opposing force of innovation , creativity and growth . the factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled . the idea , is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one's internal voice / conscience through the looking , it makes one feel as opposed to just watch .",1,10
"this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong . a simple robbery . pick up some serious change . get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory . but mom and pop's jewelry store ? no problem . insurance pays for it all . no guns . nobody gets hurt . easy money . older , more successful ( it would appear ) brother andy ( philip seymour hoffman ) has a few minor problems . heroin addiction , cocaine habituation . a wife ( marisa tomei ) that well , he cannot seem to perform for . his flat belly days long gone . younger , sweet , slightly dim-witted younger brother , hank ( ethan hawke ) with a few dinero problems of his own . behind in child support payments for his daughter , in debt to friends and relatives , not exactly wowing them in the work of work , etc . sydney lumet , in this performance at the age of 82 ( ! ) , directs and gets it 99 . 99 percent right , which is hard to do in a thriller . i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes , the improbabilities , the cheesy scenes , and the hurry-up ending . here lumet makes a thriller like it is a work of art . every detail is perfect . the acting is superb . the plot has no holes . the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself . hoffman of course is excellent . when you do not have marquee , leading man presence , you have to get by on talent , workmanship and pure concentration . ethan hawke , who is no stranger to the sweet , little guy role , adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we do not know whether to pity him or trash him . albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age . and marisa tomei , who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity , manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy's two timing wife . ( but who could blame her ? ) it's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars , but if you study this film , as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do , you will notice the kind of excessive ( according to most hollywood producers ) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do , and indeed cannot help but do . ( by the way , i think there were twenty producers on this film well , maybe a dozen; check the credits . ) all i can say in summation is , way to go sydney lumet , author of a slew of excellent films , and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced age kudos . may we all do half so well . okay , the 00 . 01 percent . it was unlikely that the father ( albert finney ) could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail . this is minor , and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip . also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end . we can guess and guess . perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor . perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out , and he just said , ""leave it like that . it really does not matter . "" and i think it does not . what happens to hank is not going to be good . he is not the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life . he is the kind of guy who gets a ""light"" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he was not really a man when he should have been . see this for sidney lumet , one of hollywood's best , director of the pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , the group ( 1966 ) , serpico ( 1973 ) , dog day afternoon ( 1975 ) , network ( 1976 ) , and many more .",1,10
"frank capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film . while it has a few charming moments , and many wonderful performers , capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story , broadway bill ( 1934 ) , is downright shoddy . it is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race , which is thrilling . but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors , then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice , for example , that ward bond is 14 years older ! unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy , skip this one and watch broadway bill instead .",0,2
"by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it . still , instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it , they went ahead and made it anyway . apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film , they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible . hell , it worked for the wild bunch so why should not it work here ? of course , the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old-fashioned rubbish . it's hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles . heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw ( coburn ) . the hunt becomes even more personal when heston's daughter ( barbara hershey ) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation . this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail . it's tremendously disappointing really , because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect . there's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either . it takes an eternity to get going , but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness . all in all , this might be the very worst film that heston ever made . i'm sure it is one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv .",0,3
"this is a great , ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was . i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid . it does not help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when i was ten . turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan . so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile , but i love it now , as a 24 year old . i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover , but to my surprise , it ruled . it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal . and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd . this movie is awesome , if you love 80s metal and bad movies , this one's for you . 9/10 !",1,9
"alan rudolph is a so-so director , without that special touch . as an example , there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife . rudolph squandered it . the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices , with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms . you get the idea of their desolation and isolation , but not much more . the lighting , the colors , the body language , the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon . if i were directing , i would have spent all day , if necessary , to get that shot right . that's the beauty and power of film : it can express so much , whole lives , in a matter of seconds the shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on . the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle , should have stomped and shuffled her feet , should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention . campbell did not deliver . he plays a uncommunicative man , true , but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice , gesture , body movement , the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego , played by denis leary .",0,2

"i watched this film version of r . d . blackmore's classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 a&e version was released on video . and what a poor substitution it proved to be ! ! ! ! this version does not have the authentic , i-feel-like-i'm-there aspect of the a&e movie . the actors are , for the most part , wooden ( with sean bean the exception ) and the ""romance"" seems forced and contrived . in fact , there is no kissing until the end of the movie ! ! ! ! the triangle between john ridd , lorna doone ( or lady lorna dugal , whichever you prefer ) and the evil carver doone is not mentioned or expanded upon . we do not get much insight into carver here , or as to why he has some ( if any ) romantic feelings for lorna . this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel , such as counsellor doone , and john's sharp-tongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot . the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction . the political intrigue also does not figure in the script . the way lorna came into being with the doones is not true to the original story . now , do not get me wrong , clive owen is a handsome and talented actor ( watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation ) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout , and long hair ( it may have been a bad wig ) just does not suit him ! ! ! ! polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress ( see enchanted april and patriot games , in which she also costarred with sean bean ) , but she appears colorless and lackluster . she has a cold sore on her lip that make-up cannot hide , and the costumes do not seem authentic . the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone , although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter , which she was reputed to be in the book . also , it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles ( maybe it is the make-up ) and the scenery is brown , cold , gray and barren , without so much of a hint of a sunny sky . i understand that it is set in southwest england , but it is green there and they do get their sunshine ! ! ! the portrayal of tom faggus' character and his ""death"" , which does not happen in the novel , depresses the film even more . the one positive note is sean bean's performance as carver . although it does not even come close to matching aidan gillen's portrayal in the a&e movie , bean does make one mean villain . in short , watch this only if you have got a few hours to kill , but do not expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel . see any other version ( but i highly recommend a&e's film ) over this tired adaptation .",0,2

"this is a film that takes some digesting . on the one hand , we are offered a tough outward shell , a story that does not only derive the catholic church , but does so foolishly , and uninformed . on an inner layer , we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis , and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand . at first glance , it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy . if so , then mr . durang needs to open a dictionary , because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word . the jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered . in particular , ms . keaton's performance is flighty and over the top , well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days . jennifer tilly is again the model of stridence , with her hi-pitched voice and whining style . all of this could be forgiven if it were not for the last 20 minutes of this movie , that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981 . ***careful , spoilers ahead*** it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary ignatius ( ignatius , by the way , is a male name , and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact , just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with . ) when they all admit that they do not live up to the church's teachings , the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny , all-too-clich sepia-tone flashbacks . when one of them admits to having two abortions , the nun becomes even more abusive , until the pupil pulls out a gun . after wrestling it away from her , the nun kills the pupil , presumably in self-defense . she then goes on a screaming rampage , killing a gay former student because of his sins . the last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a christ-like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her . can you say `heavy handed ? ' i knew you could ! i know there have been abusive nuns in the past , and i know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result , but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie . i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously , no pun intended . this explanation is hard to swallow , though , simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another . this film is simply anti-catholic tripe , which in the name of fairness and equality , is mean spirited and hateful . this is a film i would recommend for a catholic , namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today . if it were `rabbi ray explains it all' or `imam muhammad explains it all' , there would be rioting in the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscription . but , sadly , because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority , it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view . i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic , so it was not just ignorance that brought them to make this film . i give it 1 . 5 stars out of 5 , not because of its offensive nature , but because it was poorly written , poorly directed and just a bad movie in general . don't even waste your time .",0,1
"oh my , i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i've ever seen . i'm serious , this is one of the ultimate b-movies . the first proof is that it is not a $5 dvd . oh no , that is too mainstream for this . i got this on vhs , from a bin full of ex-rental videos at my local video store . if i may quote the blurb : ""in 17th century japan , there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages . his name was mayeda . he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5 , 000 muscats from the king of spain . whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan . "" it then goes on to say ""a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents"" i must have seen a different movie . this was no epic , and it certainly was not a multi million dollar anything . no , 'shogun mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of the engrish-speaking mayeda ( sho kosugi ) . he is not even a shogun really , but thats not important . what is important , is that he does a really cool impression of john cleese's repeated charging of the one castle in 'monty python and the holy grail' , and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers . awesome . the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi's engrish accent . the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie , but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever , delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever . and honestly , do you really want anything else ? you could fast forward 'shogun mayeda' to the end , and replay kosugi's final line over and over . the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line . awesome . 2/10 - so very very cheesy .",0,2
"another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice . florence who ? that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen . i soon found out who florence rice was , a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance . as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece . from 1939 , its a different time but therein lies the charm . it transports you into another world . it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious . florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine . she is absolutely delightful , at the same time strong , vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman . watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie . she made over forty movies , and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine . alan marshal is of the flynn/gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence . buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments , but the real star is florence rice . fans of 30's/40's movies , don't miss this one !",1,10
"this film was so predictable , that during the entire time you are hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent , and there is some other big twist still coming . however . . . it does not . he just continues to act creepy , and she continues to ignore it . mary found very incriminating evidence at his place , and she still trusted him ? and what was that ""baiting the trap"" ? there was no trap . she confronted him , he said ""excuse me . i have to go kill someone"" he left , and that was the end of it . they make attempts to use other suspects , ( like that one older carnival girl at the end ) but they are completely underdeveloped . actually , all the characters are underdeveloped . they have no depth , and the setting is just plain strange . . . who hangs out in a recycling factory ? ? its choppy and nothing is well developed . for example : when she leaves his place after having the beer , and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car . . . what was that ? her reactions were not portrayed . in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape- but then all we see is her showering the next morning . booooooooo it could have been so much better . . sooo much better .",0,3

"this agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 . i remember opening the movie-section of the l . a . times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for ""chapter two"" filled with glowing captions like : ""better than 'the goodbye girl' ! "" and ""neil simon does it again ! "" what does neil simon do ? he takes an autobiographical situation ( remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse ) and makes it rusty , unpleasant and--worst of all--unfunny . james caan plays neil--er . . that is , george--a writer who cannot seem to get back into life after losing his wife; enter spirited marsha mason ( real-life mrs . simon . . . soon to be ex-mrs . simon ) who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy . mason is very appealing here and might have saved the day were it not for caan's indifference ( not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin , blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt ) . i liked mason's outburst at the end ( ""i am wonderful ! i am nuts about me !

"this movie reminded me that some old black & white movies are definitely worth the look . initially i had some reservations , however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated . i was very impressed with the mixture of drama , suspense & comedy . arthur askey ( tommy gander ) is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time . definitely add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and ""too"" powerful or overly ""funny"" movies of today .",1,10
"this is why i so love this website ! i saw this film in the 1980's on british television . over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life . with barely a few key words to remember it by , i traced the film here , and much information , including the fact it is about to become an off-broadway musical ! interestingly , unlike the previous comment maker , i do not remember finding this film sad , or exploitative . on the contrary , the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength , honour and dignity . ironic you may think , considering the squalor of their lives . maybe it is because i live in britain , where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money , where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit , deep and profound humour , whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect . in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult' . over the years , as it faded in my mind , it shone the brightest , above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience . it was such a deeply private expose , it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical . but perhaps somewhere , the daughter will be amused by such an outcome . it is she who will have the last laugh maybe . .

"one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema ( or , indeed , most anything done outside these holier-than-thou united states ) are the permutations that crop up . in post-world war two japanese manga ( comics ) , for instance , are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects , many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion . the same thing happens in genre film-making , as well; though , again , i'm referring to movies made outside the u . $ . ( where we are just too ""sophisticated"" in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that is not about or by us ) . would an american company , for instance , back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler ( el santo ) or a werewolf ( paul naschy ) or a real-life martial artist ( bruce lee ) . . . ? as for television : forget it . while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine , i've always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was- how to put it kindly- a bit lacking . to this very day , there has not been a pay-per-view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia . ( there are lots of soft-core porn masquerading as entertainment shows , but the so-called action channel , for instance , has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries . ) before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc , there was , of all things , at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery : the 5 deadly venoms . in its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit ( western , cop show , etc . ) , this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work . it's now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent , thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve . if you are a martial arts movie fan , rejoice : one of the greatest movie genres of all time ( specifically , the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s ) are getting a long-overdue second life ( and greatly appreciated second look ) on dvd .",1,10
"i cannot believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes . it's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent . my biggest problem with the movie is that it does not seem to condemn these assaults - as in , the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions , and neither does anyone else . one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him , but he is reprimanded only with ""you cannot force a woman to love you"" rather than ""you should never force a woman sexually , you jerk"" . . . from a woman's point of view , the movie is a let down . it sort of ""throws a bone"" to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders , but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power , with men dominating the woman they love . this amazing martial arts fighter does not use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers . she never even makes them apologize - rather , she seems apologetic . overall , a depressing and upsetting movie , with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes , but not as good as hero by a long shot .",0,4
"i usually read reviews before i watch a movie . guess what , i did not do that before watching tlb , and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb . i found it to have a total lack of story . you just get dropped into it ( and , sadly , not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie ) , and it also has a sudden end , which was very unsatisfying for me . i have to admit , the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me , especially with the low budget in mind . but prepare yourself to have a laugh . . . some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts . a mid-air corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me , especially when it is performed countless times during the movie . . . but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat . the screaming and shouting german voices . . . unbelievably funny . it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer , because they all sound exactly the same , and it just sounds like a 'typical' german voice . i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone , except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it .",0,4

"we all create our own reality , or do we ? that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality . blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m . c . escher , this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `who are we and what is our place in the universe ? ' , and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes . the film centers on bart , a writer struggling with his screenplay , `the sea that thinks . ' as he sits at his computer , the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer , writing the screenplay . before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality . director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception . ultimately , de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be , or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses . note : after you have seen the movie , check out the film's entertaining web site .

"brokedown palace is the story of two best friends , alice and darlene , who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage . in this way , the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film , such as ""return to paradise"" , but instead , the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship . claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances , and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion , the jealousy , the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship . this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life ( which is a bit glossed over ) , and focuses more on these friendship issues . there were some plot holes here , and some parts that just did not seem believable or realistic . we did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have . and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls , with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold . in short , this should , by all rights , have been a much darker movie than it was . but overall , i enjoyed it . the acting was good , the soundtrack was perfect , and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting . worth seeing .",1,7
"well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today . what a major disappointment ! 1 ) if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u . s . military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are . they mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played i - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself , ""say what ? there is no way that would happen like that . .

"""pet sematary"" is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title . the story follows the creeds - an all american , middle-class family , who move into a house out in the country . the family consists of louis and rachel , and their two young children , ellie and their toddler son , gage . the house could not be better , and the family meets a strange but friendly old man , jud , who lives across the road . he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves . and just beyond there , lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power . when the family cat , church , is killed , louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough , soon after , church returns to life . but there is something evil about him now , he is not the same cat he used to be . and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage , louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son . . . unfortunately , he gets more than he bargained for . having read stephen king's novel , i can say that the book is much better than the film . not to say the movie is bad , because it is not - the book is just a little bit better . the real strength in this film lies in it is story , which is both bizarre but extremely original , something that king's stories are typically known for . the script is very well adapted from the story , and while it minorly differs in some aspects , it is a pretty good page-to-screen transformation . there are a few plot holes here and there , nothing major though . besides that , this movie is actually pretty scary , and it succeeds in it is intention to do so . there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film , and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel's sister zelda is the number one . honestly , that is one of the most disgusting , disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film - it is not gory and bloody , it is just flat out sickening . one thing's for sure , that image will not leave your head anytime soon . the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there . this film is actually on the gory side , there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there , including the shocker of an ending . i really liked the way they ended the film , it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive , but it worked better that way with all things considered . overall , ""pet sematary"" is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general . the story is the film's greatest asset and it is a creepy one too . one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say . 7/10 .",1,7
"i've never been impressed by jd anyway , and final justice ( which i had not seen prior to its mst3k airing ) proves to be no exception . it's not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell : it is just that there is less that geronimo ( ""call me 'heronimo' ) to dislike . in fact , one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge-seeking agent of joe don's trying to get the ""star"" killed by inducing a heart attack . joe don must have found a new agent , since he is now graduated to ""comic relief"" in james bond movies . the problem is , it is hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there , and his ""serious"" characters in his action-movies like this one . as for the plot . . . umm , what plot ? they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you will think you were watching groundhog's day 2 . presumably , the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort . ummm , yeah , whatever . on the plus side , the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous , so that kicked it up to a 2 for me . one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades , though .",0,2
this is not another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved . this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein ( jutta lampe ) is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side . ruth's daughter hannah ( maria schrader ) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer ( doris schade ) and so she travels to germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse . *****spoiler alert***** lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release . eight year old ruth ( svea lohde ) awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena ( katja riemann ) who takes her in . lena's husband fabian ( martin feifel ) is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do something . this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe . this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved . this film is not trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period . part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and it is always good to see schrader ( aimee & jaguar ) in a pivotal role . this is not a great film or something that is going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story .,1,7

"i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows . i saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me . computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name""the jetsons"" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic . shortly after that till the end . . . i could not believe my eyes ! ! ! ! how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen . just songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head . anyway , i wish to see this space-aged family ( also the flintstones and yogi bear ) in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug's life . the best style for hanna-barbera's in my opinion .",0,1
"after the already disappointing ""final conflict"" , the series hits rock-bottom with this very weak fourth entry . at least the third film tried ( unsuccessfully ) to continue the story of damien , while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the ""omen"" ( animals are afraid of the antichrist , the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film ) . but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here . and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid .",0,3
"the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen , but it is pretty far down on the list . when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i , one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions . and he succeeds , at least at first . a love triangle complicates the story some . this really was a tedious movie , with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who were not . the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable ( not the zombie part of it but parts related to the ""romance"" ) . and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography , the camera work did not seem to help the film much either . while i have seen a few movies that are worse , this is unlikely to please anyone . it's bad , and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way .",0,2
"hi . . i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connery's movies , it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast , especially connery . . it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies , so the dialog is pretty good in this one . . it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever , when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic . . i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough , really do not miss this one ! do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck , it was as intense as the rest of the movie , i really find just cause a very entertaining movie . .",1,10
"lorne michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies . you'd think that after such dismal flicks ""superstar"" , ""night at the roxbury"" , and ""coneheads"" , he would start to get the notion that maybe he does not know what he is doing when it comes to movies ( and many would argue that he does not know what he is doing when it comes to television , as well ) . trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense . i personally like tim meadows , and think that he would be great in the right movie . it's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation , and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene . any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad , not because it is funny . oh well , at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them . it's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen .",0,1
"this , the direct-to-video death rattle of the tremors series , features sixty inspired seconds ( sawblade : you will know it when you see it ) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence , tops . the lackluster , cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through , much less enjoy this film . if you are not among them- do not bother .",0,4

iberia is nice to see on tv . but why see this in silver screen ? lot of dance and music . if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie . but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time . if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it is better to see bollywood movie . they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie . director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience . and time to time it is look really good . but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting . there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big .,0,4
"i rented this film from netflix for two reasons - i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length superman film . needless to say , after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised . an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor . lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation . a day later , strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent . it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core . supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism . released in 1951 , starring a lead actor who served in world war ii , the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else . to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner , reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point . even in the 1950s , the science underlying this film was nonexistent . six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle , let alone the ""hollow center of the earth"" - which , in any case does not exist . forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book . the film is a little unevenly paced . although the molemen are interesting , a bit creepy , and nicely portrayed , there are several corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior . the script is intelligent and economical . by today's standards , the costuming is poor to fair , but for its time , this film's special effects and costuming were quite good . the cinematography is also generally very good , and the acting is much better than one might expect . i was particularly impressed with reeves , jeff corey and walter reed .",1,7
"when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it s not a normal movie . it has no real story just characters , a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony . the dialogue is wonderful , you can just lay back and listen . the movie stands out thats why it s hard to find a right way of describing it . thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed . i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the ""normal"" . you can t really put the finger on what s so wonderful about it it s just a comical world where gangsters rule . a place of love and danger . a movie that you can see more than one time .",1,8
"one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out , it goes in a completely different direction . there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching . one thing i also like about director john dahl ( kill me again , rounders , unforgettable ) is that he can be depended upon to direct and , in this case , write ( with his brother rick ) a good story . now , add nick cage , dennis hopper , lara flynn boyle , and j . t . walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected . dahl seems to bring out the best in folks , and this will keep you interested , and guessing , until the very end .",1,7
"this does give away some of the plot , by the way . a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday . this , however , does not . it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas , there even is another christmas play , but fails with lackluster and easy jokes . charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean ( $25 gloves . . . what ? ) . his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie . here is one of her jokes : sally wants to write a letter to santa , but does not know how to spell charlie ( for some reason he needs to be in her letter ) so instead decides to name him sam , because she knows how to spell sam . also , sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day : ""hark ! "" she instead says hockey stick ( har har ) . if sally saying hark 12 times ( all oddly sounding exactly the same ) does not kill you , nothing will . peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point , but that hardly makes it better . marcy is funny with her responses to patty , but patty is another story . she sounds like a boy ( which does not dispel the rumors ) and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play ( terrible baas and all ) . apparently she is the sheep every year , and is worried she will forget her lines ( lines she does not have ) . she is so worried she mentions it twice , one right after the other , and gets the same response . i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss , or something . lucy and linus are more welcome ( although linus still has annoying advice ) , but hardly amount to much air time . i'm sure schroeder is not even in this one . all in all , it tries to be a parasite to the original , but compromised the message for a few quick laughs .",0,3
"alain chabat is a fine actor , writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when aristophanes was still learning that it is 'i' before 'e' except after 'c' . but , like i said , chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to . i'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to charlotte gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance . if you absolutely insist on knowing , the 'plot' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single . this does not sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend , allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him , thus getting him off the hook . naturally they wind up together but along the way there is some sub-benedek and beatrice duelling and all things considered it is a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question .",1,8

"otto preminger , completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox , reunited his ""laura"" leads for this stark , gritty detective drama . dana andrews again portrays a cop , but this time he is hardened , cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - ""you do not hate hoods , you liked to beat them up ! "" . mark dixon ( andrews ) despises criminals , as his own father was a crook . he does not want to be ""sandy dixon's kid"" so he became a policeman , but his methods are harsh and hated . one night , investigating a murder , he unknowingly punches a suspect , ken paine ( craig stevens ) so hard that it kills him . a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up , intending to frame a hated thug , scalise ( gary merrill ) for the crime . however , the blame falls on paine's father-in-law , jiggs taylor ( tom tully ) , whose daughter , department store model morgan taylor ( tierney ) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes . paine had slapped his wife , enraging her father , who did show up at his son-in-law's apartment , but not until dixon had departed with the body . with no better suspects , jiggs is arrested and charged . riddled with guilt , mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney . he decides to take on scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death , confessing everything . in the end , he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done , and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan . despite all the tragic circumstances , morgan professes her love for mark and will wait for him . it was great to find this film on dvd , after so many years of televised obscurity . eddie mueller , a film noir historian , provides the commentary and does a good job , but i find his assertion that audiences would not have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads , since ""laura"" had been made six years earlier . in that respect , he is mistaken because they had appeared in ""the iron curtain"" two years prior to wtse and the film was a box-office success . andrews and tierney were fabulous together , and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha , fanning the flames between the detective and the dame . the night cityscapes give the film an air of menace . gary merrill is great as the low-life scalise , who had a criminal past with dixon's dad ( ""your father liked me , "" he taunts mark ) . karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also . and tom tully is just touching and funny as morgan's unjustly accused pop . a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast .",1,10

"i'll start by relating my first encounter with prince's music . it was in a bar , on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to ""1999"" playing on the speakers . i asked people , who is this singer ? i was told it was prince . it was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful , topless dancer . later i started hearing other prince songs and really ""digging"" them . when purple rain came out i still knew very little about this fellow minnesotan . the movie blew me away . i instantly became prince's no . 1 fan of the ""war baby"" generation . later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary , and she got me , and my nephew into a v . i . p . prince concert where we sat next to his mother . . . how cool is that ! getting back to the topic at hand , i agree with siskel & ebert who called purple rain an instant classic . i have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it . i thought prince's acting was fine , apollonia struggled a bit , but all in all the acting was fine . john gielgud was not available to play 'the kid' so prince took the role . the film is visually stunning , brilliantly paced ( it never gets slow ) , and terrifically directed . i rank it among the best movie musicals of all time . the last time i watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered . i am so proud of fellow minnesotan prince rogers nelson and would love to tell him personally . he walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said , ""hi"" , to my nephew but not me . he was chatting with his mom . i was a bit crushed but he is still no . 1 with me .",1,10
"this was a favorite of my childhood - i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own , i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday , and he liked it . during abu's fight with the giant spider , my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared . ""is he gonna beat the spider , poppa ? "" just watch , you will see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of ( eight years old ) , so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al-raschid might as well be oz under ozma . i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief , and not the grown-up king . in fact , if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit , the king is the thief's sidekick , not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative , adventurous young boys . it's definitely a period piece - i suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve , my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented , ""why does ahmad love the princess ? because the narrative demands it . "" the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy ( repeatedly ) for the clueless , love-struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses , fifty-foot genies and the temple of the all-seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous , as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his ( stolen ) magic carpet , seeking ""some fun , and adventure at last !

"a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims , along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine , and here susan lucci performs as a siren , although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one . isabelle ( lucci ) , inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins ( john o'hurley ) , begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis ( philip casnoff ) , simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard , apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent . when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband , he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself , coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart . in the wake of the hit-man's assault upon collins , a pair of police detectives , performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott , become increasingly curious concerning isabelle's possible involvement in the crime , while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering . lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators , each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds , but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements . released upon a fremantle dvd , this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality , and although no extra features are provided , the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards .",0,4

"i am of ""the christopher reeve generation"" it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet , but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role , and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top , though he just barely falls short . that does not stop me from enjoying this film , it has a lot going for it . it has all that a movie needs , a plot with beginning , middle , and end , plus all those parts are intelligently written . the film is edgy both in acting and storyline , something a film-noir but with tights . the story is both exciting and meaningful , this is a movie with a message that is not too preachy . i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days , oh the glory days of hollywood , when we did not have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell . . . the film is polished and expertly made , directed by lee ""roll'em"" sholem , best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down , in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight , including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman's point of view , also a few closeups of george in process work , and a long shot of an animated superman . this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series . a dvd worth owning in its own right , the inclusion of the film as its original whole , is icing on the cake . give blood today god bless !",1,8
"this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave . it even surpasses his wonderful performance as ""johnny eager"" coming a full 14 years after that film . his looks are still a wonder to see , but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty , violent role . charlie gilson ( taylor ) is the last of his breed , a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure . his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings , is stunning to watch . he is basically a lonely man , needing the people around him , but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior . his partner is sandy mckenzie ( stewart granger ) who is sick of the hunt , and only goes along , because he is a failure at anything else . along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent . charlie tries to seduce her to no avail , but sees that sandy is interested in her also . granger is kind of sad to watch , so fed up with the hunt , longing to go away with the girl and her baby . lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing . russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world . the group is an odd mix of good and evil , young and old . in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo , as many hunters before him had , and runs off leaving sandy with the girl . upon his return , that night sandy leaves with the woman , setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself . the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it . it is taylor's film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era .",1,10
"as i watched one of orson welles' last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker , i knew i was watching a great movie unfold , though at times i did not know why . the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film-noir : average-joe lead , femme fatale , conspicuous supporting characters , and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure . it is an entertaining ride , and it is filled to the brim with welles' unique gifts as a director , but there are scenes that tend to just not work , or do not feel complete in what was welles' full vision ( the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that ) . welles co-stars with his then wife , the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth , as mike o'hara , an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people . hayworth is mrs . bannister , married to mr . bannister ( everett sloane , who played mr . bernstein in citizen kane ) , who is accompanied by a friend mr . grisby ( glenn anders , who has great control in his eyes ) . they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o'hara along for the ride , and at first he is reluctant , but agrees since he is falling for the married mrs . as their journey unfolds , o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around , and more so with grisby , who at first seems out of his gourd . yet as the plot unfolds , o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money , with results that i dare not reveal ( although they have been discussed over and over by others ) . whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story ( and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated ) , the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty-five years . though he does not have the terrific greg tolland ( kane's dp ) at his side , dependable charles lawton jr . assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark , covered in shadows , deep focus , low angles , the works . a particular accomplishment is the fun-house mirror scene , which is merely a highlight among others . welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent is not anything special- and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush , despite her path in the story . the lady from shanghai is worth checking out , especially for welles , hayworth , or film-noir buffs ( fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well ) . it may just take a little while , repeat viewings ( as was for touch of evil ) , for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in .",1,9
"on paper this looked like a great concept : average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator , who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis . however , director ivan reitman and writer don payne ( of the ""simpson's"" ) almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl ( played by striking uma thurman ) come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson . the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders ( luke wilson ) following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty . jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like . matt replies , ""she is kind of nutty "" i think the intent was to have jenny ( thurman ) be this lonely young woman , who has no one in her life , isolated by her great physical powers . thurman does the best she can , but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac . luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend . ""my super ex-girlfriend"" is also a victim of bad timing , coming on the tail end of ""superman returns"" which plays superhero straight up , so to speak . with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought ""my super ex-girlfriend"" was funny and enjoyed the movie . given that this is an ivan reitman movie , this could have been a lot better . reitman starts with a great premise , and really squanders it . first off , we all love the hero . here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable . this is surprising for uma thurman , who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence . in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird . shocking . because if there is a woman who can play a superhero , she is thurman she looks great . only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic , instead of caricature . although ""my super ex"" is not a straight superhero story , rather a romantic comedy of sorts , it does not provide what every superhero mythology requires a great super villain . here we have professor bedlam aka barry ( eddie izzard ) who really is evil lite . he is no lex luthor . no plans for global domination . bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl , and expectedly it has to do with their shared past . what is bizarre you do not know who you would rather spend time with bedlam or g-girl ? luke wilson's matt is just ""some dude"" who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero . one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn ( rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation ) . wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense , and this dilutes his likable charm . this does however work , in the comic sex scene with jenny . matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah ( perky anna faris ) . so how does matt break up with g-girl ? well , it is not pretty and for the most part hilarious . dramatic superhero movies work . romantic comedies with chemistry work . what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies . everyone loves the hero . however , hero nut job ? maybe not . with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly . and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne . thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings . ""my super ex-girlfriend"" is fun and funny . though given all involved , the movie could have been super .",1,7
"having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time . it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience . i have to say that while i agree films do not have to make sense to be enjoyable ( see mulholland drive ) they still have to engage you with the characters . now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's opus , i have to say i could not give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world . also , while so many people seem to try and say you did not enjoy because you did not get it i would have to disagree - i did not enjoy because i was bored . i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help . call it clever if you will - i think it is repetitious . however , my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw . just music over black . did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr's pretentiousness ? or , did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed ? ? ?",0,1

"this might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made . the writers and producers should study the german films of the thirties and forties . they knew how to sell . even soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father-figure were better done . disappointing . the loss of faith , regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be ""saved"" by the hoover/god was not too bad . unfortunately , it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough . a few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot . the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and children who had ""proven"" their worth . unfortunately , other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the hoover-god does not help them . a better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition . finally , bright and cheerful scenes of recovery ( after hoover saved the country from the depression ) should have rolled at the end . we could see then how hoover-god had saved not just this deserving family , but all the truly deserving . amateurist at best .",0,1

"this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind , tsui hark . it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow is shaolin soccer . from the moment the movie started , there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were deplicted with superb style . if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts ""geek"" , you will love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons . there , comes a fine performance ( as always ) from ekin cheung who plays ""sky king"" . he teams up with louis koo ( red ) who i was very impressed by his flexible ""wing"" which deflected incoming attacks . the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way . not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline . many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just ""shoved in random bits of debrise"" and even describe as ""the legend of poo"" . however , the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie . others who are famarialy with ""wu xia"" movies will have a better appoach . in due respect . there can be one weakness that could be foreseen . the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made . in spite of all this , its a must see .",1,8
"welcome to our town , welcome to your town ? as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america , this three act play is opened before us with the help of ""the stage manager"" , a visual narrator if you like . after his initial introductions , we are lead into the homes of two particular families; the webb's and the gibb's . this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners , new hampshire , even if there are , too , the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a look-in . once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking , children home-working , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young george ( a young and unrecognisable william holden , then aged 22 ) and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered . it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . this is not just about ""our"" town , this is moral diction aimed at ""our"" souls and how america can better itself if its peoples' , ( excluding the poles , the irish , the native american and the freed ethnic minorities' , and minorities' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative ) , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest , decent living . the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only . i was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . this was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's , in the future of the developing country of the usa , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , i thought . taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder ( 1897 - 1975 ) this pulitzer prize winning play , and six academy award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the ""right sort of people"" , you can still leave your back-door unlocked here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . our town may just have been ""any town"" , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .",0,3

"i must admit , when i read the description of the genre on netflix as ""steamy romance"" i was a little bit skeptical . ""steamy"" ? in a movie from 1968 ? ? i was prepared for disappointment . and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white , i knew my erotic hopes were dashed . boy , was i wrong ! not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love , fear of the secret being found out , a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic . you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white . the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years . and the performances from the two stars ( essy persson and anna gael ) are intense and memorable . ok , so they are both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls . it's 1968 . do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this ? many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then . anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much . i think this movie was way ahead of its time . the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination , opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown . i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here . as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action : although it will not be all you expect , i do not think you will be too , too disappointed .",1,8

"note : i will reveal a key part of the plot , but if you have looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material , you will already know it . this movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it . the writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism . forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary . forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they do not wear protective gear ( not even gloves ) . these are quibbles in the context of this movie . in the scientific world within this story , 2+2=6 . 34 and gravity goes sideways . the fact is that the people in this movie do not ( with a few exceptions ) behave the way human beings behave . almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate . the love story ( of course there is one ) makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare . i cannot believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing .",0,1

"saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately , afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect ( direction , acting , cut , musical score . . . ) . the sets are outstanding and very impressive , the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film , the dictator of ""everytown"" is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming , believable and ideally cast as ""the hero"" . the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes , even after watching the film so many times . this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen , so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema . please do , it is overwhelming .",1,10
"probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made , this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last . director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what is more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen . not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn , but the setting is absolutely out of this world ! just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging , pervasive fog . this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar's inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players . the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine , beautiful , spirited yet vulnerable . robert barrat delivers his usual no-nonsense , straight-down-the-line portrait of the local bigwig , though it is hard to believe that the personable , good-looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer/director blake edwards .",1,9
"jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands , trying to make sense of what he is just done . meanwhile , a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency's response to what is just happened on screen . an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot , but as he speaks , it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory , as if it does not want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security . this shot effectively captures the mood of the film . as well as portraying bourne's quest to find out how he became jason bourne , ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security . it is also probably the best film you will see in the cinema this year . it's just so intense . bourne says to simon ross ( considine ) ""this is not some newspaper story , this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him . the camera shakes , but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you are there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers , and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they are portraying , instead of just being actors performing well-written roles . the action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing . the pacing is just incredible . it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion , but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece . while they are often simple ( the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone ) they are charged with such dramatic intensity that you cannot take your eyes off them . the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you cannot help being swept along by it . with its intense action set-pieces , brilliantly paced storyline , and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security , the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . ultimatum is its peak .",1,9

"i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'zombie bloodbath' as one of it is alternative titles . perversely , this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad ! this film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself 'zombie bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece , and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display . . . but it all feels very old and tired , which is not helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line . it's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc . the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you are in for; low quality zombie garbage . there's plenty of gore in the film , and it is a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring . zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too , and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers ! the main influence seemed to be romero's superior day of the dead , although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore . it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i cannot say i was impressed with it !",0,3

"with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention , but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate . i know i did . the story is interesting and deals with time traveling . a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole ( bruce willis ) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus . in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital . there he meets jeffrey goines ( brad pitt ) , who probably has something to do with the virus . he also meets psychiatrist dr . kathryn railly ( madeleine stowe ) who does not believe him in 1990 . when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories . the movie constantly plays with time . cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 , it is picked up in the future and ""they"" send someone . for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call . things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention . you could ask some questions but since you cannot have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie . 'twelve monkeys' works as sci-fi , with some great images and a dark atmosphere , and it works as a thriller . you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie . may be it has some flaws in the story , but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling , you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy . that was the easy part for me .",1,10

"sexo cannibal , or devil hunter as it is more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences , starts with actress & model laura crawford ( ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner ) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane ( gisela hahn ) . after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named chris ( werner pochath ) & thomas ( antonio mayans ) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane . laura's agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero peter weston ( al cliver ) who is informed of the situation , the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom . peter is told that he will be paid 200 , 000 to get her back safely & a further 10% of the 6 million if he brings that back as well , faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter & his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island & deciding on how to save laura . so , the kidnappers have laura & peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much . just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe ( hell , in all the generations they have lived there they have only managed to build one straw hut , now that is primitive ) who worship some cannibal monster dude ( burt altman ) with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young , white female flesh & intestines . . . this spanish , french & german co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well . sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the 'video nasties' list in the early 80's under it is alternate devil hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned , having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film & even franco , who is not afraid to be associated with a turkey , decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown . i'd imagine even the most die-hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing . the script by franco , erm sorry i mean clifford brown & julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed , is awful . it's as simple & straight forward as that . for a start the film is so boring it is untrue , the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things do not improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over-sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes . as a horror film sexo cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success , this is one to avoid . director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout , a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it is not attached to anything ! the cannibal scenes are poor , the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'a' to 'b' & not really doing anything when they get there either . it becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & do not forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it is uncut state . i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff , this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it is side & having cliver crawl along the floor ! just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along ! the gore is not that great & as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame , there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat , a man is impaled on spikes , there is some blood & a handful of intestines . there's a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene . sexo cannibal must have had a low budget & i mean low . this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values . the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic . the music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen . the acting sucks , the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act . sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell . the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross . anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible , one to avoid .",0,3

"" ) these are what this film is all about . the two leads in this film are impeccable , as if they were born to play these roles . lucy russell , who is english and speaks french as her second language , is especially brilliant . do yourself a favor and see this riveting film . it may be the last film by this screen master .",1,9

"where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones ? after all he did serve for 17+ years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering . oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth . the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper , but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton/gore in global warming . probably too close to an election year , or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in '08 . either way he is a political coward and party man to the bitter end . he offers no criticism of consumerism , no criticism of capitalism , no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time in the end this film was much more about mr . gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces . mr . gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film - shorten it & call it what it really is .",0,1
"in case you are a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making , there comes a certain point in life preferably sooner than later that you have to watch ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" . it's an inescapable certainty , as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made . one tiny but essential detail , however , is that ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" is deliberately awful . right from the opening message already , mocking alfred hitchcock's ""the birds"" , this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and i cannot escape the impression that writer/director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit . the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called ""eco-horror"" movies ( plants , animals and nature in general revolting against humanity ) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines . a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country . the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy , which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices . the first half hour of ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" is very entertaining . as silly as it is , the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny . the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song , the ""jaws"" homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash ( see the trivia section for more details ) that made it to the final cut . after that , however , the whole thing turns into a tedious , unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess . the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots . personally , i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels ( which i saw before seeing the original ) because they benefit from slightly better production values , incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin ( ""the addams family"" ) as the mad scientist dr . gangreen . but , as said before already , the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life .",0,4

"everybody knows that gregory widen's original ""the prophecy"" did not really require a sequel , but you also do not need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel , meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action , more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel , and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . if it was not for walken's performance ( and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig ) , ""the prophecy ii"" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth . the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales ( jennifer beals ) from getting born . for you see , her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly ""monkey"" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel's evil dominion . thus , just as in the first movie , he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown . ""the prophecy ii"" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you do not make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . whenever the storyline becomes too tedious , the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you . his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . on a slightly off-topic note , i often felt like ""the prophecy ii"" ambitions to look similar to ""terminator ii"" gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location , where the final battle takes place , looks very similar to the steel factory where ""terminator ii"" ended as well . coincidence , i guess ? overall , this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you are a fan of christopher walken's unique acting charisma ( and who is not ? ) .",0,4

"in the tradition of g-men , the house on 92nd street , the street with no name , now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light . while it is 48 year director j . edgar hoover was alive , it would be showed in no other kind of light . the book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it is founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out . it's important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j . edgar hoover headed it . some of that time is covered in the film as well . but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john 'chip' hardesty was created . hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties . in real life the bureau was headed by william j . burns of the burns private detective agency . it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film . burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration . when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in , he did just that . through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold . in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbi's story itself . stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple . we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with , arresting ku klux klan members , a plot to murder oil rich indians , bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties , their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war . there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own . that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight . nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today . of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american . still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one . the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart's best films , but it is the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me . if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts , i'd feel a lot better about it . there's also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson . vera miles did not just marry stewart , she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates . it's dated mostly , but still has a good and interesting story to tell .",1,7
"watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance . the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey , as i tuned in there is the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by daniel craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent . it turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend , so there is trouble brewing and not too many surprises . but i'd been caught by anne reid's compelling performance and i was hooked . the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves , when she exudes sadness . the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking . shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up ? not here and we are treated to a delicious reawakening in the mother's sexuality . even more startling are the drawings she is made that ( spoiler ! ) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on here . cathryn bradshaw as the daughter did not convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast , but that could be me . with her waves of pre-raph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla , whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind . bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did not carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses . the ending is weak . if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons . whatever she is done , she is a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years , and i found the lack of sympathy jarring . for a film so full of emotion ( and be warned it is like opening champagne , you will never get the lid back on ) the ending is a cold contradiction .",1,8
"i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie . granted , it is shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not . but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not , that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story . the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters . often during character's interacting , it is nearly difficult to distinguish who is lines are who is . granted , i believe this movie is dubbed in english . certainly they could have obtained voice actors which could have added a bit more drama to these classic , literary lines . it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 , although perhaps that is based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget . still , it is absolutely painful and boring . if you insist on hamlet , do yourself a favor and read the book again . 1/10",0,1
"movie : there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie . its truly awful . not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it , it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick . characters/actors : denzel has done ""exactly"" what he does in every movie , so no surprise there . here is a little mind game for the readers . quickly think of 10 denzel movies . now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard , whatever . clive owen , hmmmmmm , this guy needs a better role on his plate soon . his best performance was i think in ""beyond borders"" . other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well . his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in ""sin city"" . surely this guy knows acting , what he does not know is better way of choosing roles . he is in desperate need of a better agent . jodie foster was brilliant in the movie , if you are watching her for the first time in your life . she has done better . she has had better roles . it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie . plot : plot was not confusing , in fact , i could think of such a plot , in fact the whole movie , while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner . i mean come on , ****spoiler on the way----> i am sick of the un-necessary haulocast and the racism token . the movie is about bank robbers , why put the haulocast and the racism in there , nice try playing with people's emotions , worked on anyone ? not me . police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages ? riiiiiiight , please , we are talking about us police force and security here . nobody could find out where clive was , i mean they did not find anything different with that room . who're we kidding ? conclusion : sure , go watch this movie , if nothing , you will have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was . at least people will not think you are stupid to go watch this movie because they would think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast ""mistake"" .",0,1

"what a fun movie ! if you are a giallo fan , red queen kills 7 times is a real winner . to begin with , it is hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo . both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life . the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy . one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start . the killer , the red queen , is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie . the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful . in fact , all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film . the convoluted plot held my interest throughout . finally , bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer . the main theme is so memorable i have not been able to get it out of my head for two days . the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale . first , the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot . if you have seen more than a couple gialli , you will not have any problem determining who is behind the killings . second , the ending feels a little too rushed and , as a result , is a bit confusing . i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me , but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all . a second viewing might just clear this up .",1,8
"erich rohmer's ""l'anglaise et le duc"" makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins' ""la commune ( paris 1871 ) . "" both films -screened at this year's toronto international film festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale . ironic , given the tragic events that were taking place in the u . s . during the festival . set in paris during the french revolution , the movie , based on grace elliott's ( lucy russell ) ""memoirs , "" is a first-hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days . she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans ( played by jean-claude dreyfus ) , who , in contrast to herself , is a supporter of the revolution . true to form , you do not know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on . one of the earliest of the french ""new wave"" filmmakers , rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative . after all , in the midst of the rebelling-youth-viet-nam days of the late 60s and 70s , he was filming romantic little confections like ""claire's knee . "" but do not sell the old boy short , folks , he is always been a student of human nature , not an ideologue , and ""l'anglaise et le duc"" continues to bear this out . rohmer's characters are never the ""bad guys"" nor the ""good guys'; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations . that's why his movies are always provocative , and this film is no exception . now for the technological nuts and bolts . rohmer , though making his way into his 80s , is still on the cutting-edge of cinematic innovation . the look of ""l'anglaise"" is like something you have never seen before . you guessed it , the old guy -like several of the festival's directors this year- has gone digital . all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s parisian settings . as a matter of fact , you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological -and yes , i'll say it- political insights . toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year , as well as some of the world's oldest . and the old masters are standing there on cinema's cutting-edges right alongside the young ones . long live youth . long live old age . and long live erich rohmer .",1,7
"first , a little summary . this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him . nice message , government censorship and all that , but the way they did the movie was , well let me explain . this movie is beyond description . the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution . the script is atrocious on its own , like it was written by a sixth grader . as for special effects , i understand that independent films have low budgets , and some gore effects looked acceptable , but if you want a scene with fire , here's a tip : buy some nonflammable material , have an extinguisher ready , and get a fire going ! don't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game . the acting , well let us put it this way . in my summer theater program , a cold reading of the script is , compared to this , the godfather . i will not even go into the inconsistencies . find them yourself . what disturbed me the most , though , was when everything was finished after shooting and editing , somebody might have said , ""okay , this looks good . let's release it .

"with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train , this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness ! the acting was atrocious , but the story is what i really found appalling . the acting was wooden and stilted , even by early talkies standards ( the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner , neither of whom can do wrong ) . rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie ( as she likewise was in 1932's dr jekyll and mr hyde , an otherwise excellent flick ) . and the rest of the cast was worse , there being no words to describe their awfulness . worse than the acting , however , was the story . for some unknown reason , julie loves liliom , a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . he marries julie but does not support her , instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal ( lee tracy ) . and , oh yeah , he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her . julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him , which only seems to make him more abusive . what's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story . somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom . wtf ? the last 1/3 of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself ( a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police ) . as he lay dying , he tells julie ""i beat you all the time , but i'm not sorry for it . "" when he at last dies , she finally tells him she loves him . ( neither character ever said ""i love you"" to the other while they were alive . ) after his death , god's chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can ""do something good"" for his unborn daughter . the price for this is 10 years in hell . after 10 years , liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter . he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him ""do something good"" for her; he tries to get her to play cards , he tries to give her gabriel's horn , but she is not interested and rebuffs him . so he slaps her . he . slaps . her . and then he disappears back to the afterlife . looking on , we see his daughter tell julie about this . the girl says the slap did not hurt , that it felt like a kiss . this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment . the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible , and julie replies that ""someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all . "" then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train . blech ! there was one saving grace to this film , and that is the interview between the chief magistrate ( hb warner was truly magnificent here ) and liliom on the celestial train . the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death . this scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars . regarding liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems , the magistrate says ""people suppose that when they die , their difficulties are ended for them . you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities . it is not as simple as that . on earth your name is still spoken; your face is still remembered . as long as one is left who remembers you , so long is the matter unended . until you have been completely forgotten , you will not be finished with the earth , even though you are dead .

"i am currently on vacation in israel for summer , and so was able to see this incredible film . a bit of a warning before i begin writing : i speak fluent hebrew , and so the hebrew parts were no problem; however , about a quarter ( a bit less ) of the film is in arabic , and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit . this did not detract from my understanding of the film , but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater . after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships , it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet , ""the bubble"" surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting , witty dialogue , and relevant political climate . the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli-palestinian border; for the first few moments , we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on . yet , this is an important element of this film's strength . the political situation , and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background . most importantly , tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film . it is constantly referenced . street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged . the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly , and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam ( ohad knoller ) and a palestinian immigrant , ashraf ( yousef 'joe' sweid ) , with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil . we always know that their relationship is forbidden , and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema . the love is incredibly strong , and stands as the centerpiece of the film . the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong : flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's ( yousef 'joe' sweid ) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider , golan ( zohar liba ) , is particularly a source of amusement . the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite , fine crafted works of art , and the cinematography is astounding : in the first love scene of the film , the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu ( daniela virtzer ) , and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf . this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love . to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy , but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate , so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue . even when watching this movie in my second language , i could not stop laughing throughout . lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven , and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber . this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema . the music used in the film is also particularly powerful . music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it , and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other . little elements like this truly elevate the film . i could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted .",1,10
"fabulous film ! rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work . douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson , dorothy malone ( oscar winner ) , robert stack ( oscar nominated ) , and lauren bacall that words cannot describe . paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone's murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct . what a great joke ! by turns the film is hilarious , riveting , campy , biting , trashy , compelling , and eye rolling ! it's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you will see here : the camera work is smooth and polished , the use of color is breathtaking , the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable , the one dimensional characters are unforgettable , and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut ! while most older , highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through , written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it is actually a shame when it ends . thank you to mr . sirk for crafting -and todd haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time ! see this movie ! ! !",1,10
"horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic does not always win out over imagination . we all know that killers like freddy , jason , michael and even leatherface should not be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day . most of us do not believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains . and let us hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them . this is where imagination wins out over fact . horror , and most films in general , requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow . this usually is not a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c . scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville . but what i do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film . to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself , but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed . there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is . but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done , suspenseful , blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough . if the film would have offered me a different killer , then i would actually be raving about it . this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film , but believe me , anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me . john cassevetes plays dr . sam cordell . he and his daughter jenny ( played beautifully by erin flannery ) have just recently moved to this small new england town . cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died . we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour . her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed . again , i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway . cassevetes , it has to be mentioned , is strange to say the least . cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental . there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities . it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent , but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug . thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy . casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan . he has a deceptive smile and a virile , commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice . but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene . he just has that slimy , disingenuous , phlegmatic , uneasy way about him . he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film . i guess that is a credit to the writers , the director and to cassevetes himself . there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go . the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry . there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see , something or someone is watching them . when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck , the young woman wanders into the shed , just to play a prank . once she is there , she is attacked . the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail . hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in . he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner , and then smacko , the guy gets it . it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note . also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces . tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place , he has another dream . toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother , a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen . throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time , the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped . this is my first feeble ( and careful ) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement . it just did not strike the right chord . the incubus is a well done film . it is tense , tight and even most of the performances are very well done . i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders . but when you get through all that was good in the film , you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth . and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones . 7 out of 10-- this could have been a nine . too bad .",1,7
"cheap , mediocre sequel to the successful ""the mummy's hand"" has presumably dead evil professor andoheb ( george zucco ) preparing his predecessor mehemet bey ( turhan bey ) for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy kharis ( lon chaney , jr who has no reason being in the disguise . . any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims ) in the goal of killing the surviving members of the banning family whose patriarch stephen ( dick foran ) and assistant babe hanson ( wallace ford ) retrieved the mummified corpse of princess ananka from her tomb in egypt . . andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian custom . bey and the mummy kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the high priest of karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise . every full moon , bey will feed kharis a form of liquid derived of several tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes . bey commands kharis to kill stephen and his sister jane ( mary gordon ) , while also biding time for babe to return so that he will become victim # 3 . dr . john banning ( john hubbard ) plans to wed isobel ( elyse knox ) , but does not know that bey secretly covets his fianc making plans to kidnap her with kharis' help . john's life is in danger because of his father . . he is also the last remaining member of the banning line . if bey has isobel , there is no chance of any more bannings being born . the police must find kharis and the one responsible for his carnage . . bey . this film is a continuation from hand set years later as members of that film , foran , ford & zucco all appear in ""aging"" make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the bannings . the cornball romance of john and isobel seems merely in this plot so that bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up . and , bey merely sees her frolicking with john on the grass . . the whole ""love-at-first-sight"" rubbish really did not wash for me . plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm . . is any mummy really that powerful ? this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it . there really is not that much story here and yes , typical of universal monster pictures , even in america a mob of people will light . . ho hum . . torches going after kharis . you know how it will end . . john and the super-powerful kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame .",0,4

"every country which has a working film industry has some sane ( and maybe some insane ) artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you are a part of this country . i guess hundstage is such a movie . you see the lowest level of austria's society , dirty , disturbed , weird , hateful . but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses . and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them 'normal' because they are doing it through their whole life . from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria's art movies . but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society . a society that is going more insane from day to day , creating their own rules that nobody else can understand , cave the social system from within . and you see the people . sitting in the park , standing at the opposite street corner , queuing in the same line . maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit . maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house . you start to hate them without exactly knowing why . you'll try to get away - but you cannot . maybe you will end up like them . but it seems 'normal' for you because you are doing it through your whole life now . . . life is not so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world . it has beautiful people . . . but some are also ugly . there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best . . . but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so far . a very pessimistic movie .",1,8

"if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should . that's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes . unlike marilyn monroe in that film , jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means . and it is men of means that jean harlow is after . she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she is decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it . her talents as a chorus girl are limited , but she will be able to trade in on that beauty . her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone . but unbeknownst to jean , stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns . still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices . lionel's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son , franchot tone . after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree . the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship . i've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqu film . still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated . what a great comic talent that woman had , seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later . ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde , thelma todd . harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma . todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given . don't miss the girl from missouri , it is bright and sassy , must be from all that sparkling jewelry .",1,7
"vodka lemon is a charming , yet extremely uneven arminian film that will delight some and bore others . though reasonably well-crafted , the film lacks any real ""zing"" , relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer . the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance , unfortunately , they deserve a film worthy of their genius . too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama , vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled . you may laugh , but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides . a noble effort , ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion .",0,4
"you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story , believing it all , then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling . . . and then put back together again . brilliant . one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary . i do not know if - other than andrew jarecki's ""capturing the friedmans"" - there has ever been anything like anna broinowski's ""forbidden lie$ . "" it features , exposes , defends , reveals , and questions everything about norma khouri , author of ""honor lost , "" the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordan . what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this ""exposure"" of khouri is made with khouri's full participation . for the initial portion of the film , khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman , the story of the book . she sounds completely believable , convincing . then her story is taken apart , exposed , by eminently believable and convincing people , such as women's rights activists in jordan , investigative reporters there and in australia , where khouri lived for a while . khouri comes back and denies the accusations , taking a successful lie-detector test in the process . there comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value . . . and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations ( not all , but the essential ones in the matter of the book ) . and the houdini act continues , with round after round in this heavy-weight , seesaw prize fight , surprise after surprise - and there is no ""happy ending"" in the sense of resolution . brilliant .",1,7

"i watched this on an 8 hour flight and ( presumably because of the pressure and the altitude ) i actually found it mildly entertaining ( emphasis on the ""mild"" ) . the actual idea behind the film was brilliant : a woman dies , her fianc falls in love with someone else , she decided to make sure they do not get together , but eventually she lets them do it . sadly the actual film was not as good . ok , there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well . but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on . i think the whole gay-but-not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better . the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest : it was not really very funny . in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me , but it was a close call .",1,7
"if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts , do not worry , you can still watch and love the ghost train , like the equally marvellous back room boy , it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance , even that of the lead actor . personally , i love askey , perhaps it is because i go into his world , rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine , which is a mistake too many people make . the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you could not conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep , dark world it transports you to , it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it is a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once . the cast are , without exception , extraordinarily good , perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick , but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime , she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out . the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past , but waiting patiently for us to press play .",1,10
"i just could not stop laughing ! ! this movie is incredibly funny and stupid ! but , never mind that , it is very entertaining ! in this film , you do not need to pay attention to anything ! the acting is the same - lame ! the dinosaurs are the same - rubber ( oh , my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment . ) the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2 , t-rex is also the same , but . . . in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten . action is fast , sometimes too fast , actually i talk about fast editing , they edited it so fast , so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs , but oopps ! to late , they are rubber ! well , only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel . what can i say . . . do not rent it . . . watch it on tv , with friends , it is much more entertaining !",0,1
"historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans . starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin . this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women , because these were free people . they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors . the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives , whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community . i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe , anna bella , and marcel .",1,9
"everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! my grandma could have done better than that ! but that is not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) if the first episode of les visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part , robin is trying to act like lemercier ( because she is replacing her ) but that is grotesque' . lemercier is lemercier , robin is robin ! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she is not acting as she used to act . i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( lemercier obtained a c sar award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played lemercier playing her role' ! as for the story , it is just too much ! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poir and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . the gags are repetitive , childish and d j -vu . no , really , there is no more than 3 funny parts in this . the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . so you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment' ! 2/10",0,2
"the five deadly venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery . there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick : great choreography , awful dubbing , different ""styles"" of fighting , and a wide range of greatly exaggerated , often cheesey human emotions . however the plot certainly is better than average . it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes . occasionally it is even able to fire up the audience , such as when x character receives horrible injustice . another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes . just about everyone gets what is coming to them . the cowardly , greedy , and corrupt lose out . the bad guys , consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing . the good guys use teamwork , planning , and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top . poison clan rocks !",1,8

"one of the biggest hits of 1926 , brown of harvard is a exciting comedy/drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star . it's patented haines all the way : brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man/hero and wins the girl . no one worked this formula like haines . a terrific comic actor ( little annie rooney with mary pickford , show people with marion davies ) , haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression . he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines ( with lon chaney ) and west point ( with joan crawford ) , where he repeats the formula . mary brian is good as the girl , jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate , ralph bushman is the rival . edward connelly , mary alden , david torrence , guinn williams , and grady sutton co-star . this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne's film debut as a yale football player ( but i never spotted him ) . haines was a top-five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 . it's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost . he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time .",1,10

"one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams , rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins . one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s . this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside , causing the material to wash downhill , where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment . the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries . the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas . some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields , where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult . thus , the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner . first , we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor , a very rare treatment in 1938 . a story about wheat farmers and gold miners would not seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time . the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors , with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations . then , we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero , to be paired with olivia de havilland . among other things , this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it . even the usually colorful gabby hayes , in his small role , seemed unusually subdued . unfortunately , i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film . the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems . it needed to be more like ""the good earth"" , released just the year before . just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man , such as errol flynn . finally , there is the matter of the inane title . surely , warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title . ""gold or grain"" is short and to the point . incidentally , i understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills' , waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining .",0,4

i think this is a lovely family movie . there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie . the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout . danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the angels' and is great throughout the film . also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon-levitt and milton davis jr . christopher lloyd is good as al 'the angel' and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie . a touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy .,1,8

"i had heard good things about this film and was , you guessed it , a bit disappointed . reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good , surprisingly confident , at a young age; really all the ( small ) cast are quite solid , in their simple 50s american setting . the reason i did not rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end , the grief shown by the older sister did not seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit . perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot , or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer . maureen's character is quite underdeveloped i think . it is understandable that dani ( reese w . , the younger ) would be traumatised and angry , but why is her sister shown to be more upset ? because she is a few years older ? hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film ? the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met , when he gets tractored ( warning : this scene is surprisingly brutal , in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit . well it works ! ) . it depends what you want - if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you are going to get , you are in for a surprise . man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film a rather awkward combination ? i liked the character of court though , i can see what girls watching this might be watching . and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister ( most men would , most films would not ) and get killed . 7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale . for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny .",1,7

""scoop"" is another great woody allen's comedy outside manhattan , actually again in london . his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic , and i laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive ""in the wrong side"" . sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian . however , his present muse scarlett johansson , of whom i am a big fan , has over-acting and is annoying in many moments , changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation . her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous , and i was quite disappointed with her performance ( probably for the first time in her filmography ) . but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment . my vote is eight . title ( brazil ) : ""scoop o grande furo"" ( ""scoop the big scoop"" )",1,8
"i've said this in other reviews , without a story , you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want , still no one will give a damn . the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco ( which i love ) , and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making . however , it is obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie , he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film . ( spoiler ) for crying out loud , they forgot to have a villain in this thing ! ok they have one , but he is been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place . conran misses the point of having a villain . as far as action goes , well let us see , sky captain ( law ) shoots down one robot , two or three of the flapping wing airplanes ( before dex ( ribisi ) tells him to stop shooting them down ! ! ! ) , and a couple robots , but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him . paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie ( the reviewer who comments on hers and law's lack of chemistry is so right ) and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera , showing she only has two shots left , both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie , one uncomically , one quite funny , although i saw it coming from 70 years away . no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen , and that is the movie's real flaw . an audience does not identify with robots , they need a hero to root for , and a visible , despicable villain to hate . without that , plus a good engaging story , all the cg in the world will not help .",0,3

"here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea . that is the problem is not ? the concept is fresh and full of potential , but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance . it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters . this movie does not have what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why . first you do not really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to , i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here , it is suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . they are not believable in the way they act and interact . example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum , frowning and looking intense all the time is not the way to go here . i mean what is that ? , he looks like he is on the toilet or something . i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . but not for this , he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner , it is not natural , i'm surprised he did not dislocate his jaw during filming . the movie is basically on life support , it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come .",0,3

"" the storyline makes sense with no plot holes . the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine . the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts . basically , this is not my cup of tea . the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a t-shirt . so in the very beginning , you get to see reve's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state . later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors , and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues . reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum . plus there is a lot of blood . more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined . not that i have anything against ""shocking"" scenes , but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking . the whole movie is revolved around the shock value . so if any of this is your cup of tea , watch this movie . otherwise , stay far far far far far away from this one . my mind is still scarred .",0,1
"wow , this film had a huge impact on me , it moved me , . it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade . i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly . the setting of the film is realistic , the film was an eye opener , i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists . the content of the film was very very moving . it was one of the best films that i have seen this year . the girl who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character . ron livinston gives a fantastic performance . the film moved me to tears , it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide . everyone should go see this film . i think this film will make a difference , i loved it !",1,10

"tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer . like any other horror fan , i loved the texas chainsaw , but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title , you should have at least more than one hit movie . i cannot really think of any other movie hooper has done ( on his own , do not count poltergeist ) that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world . and this movie , night terrors , just backs up my point . poor robert englund , i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given . he did what he could . as for the movie itself ? pure drudge . unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes , a story that must have been penned in an our , and really just awful scenery , music , and cinematography . nothing in this film is redeemable . don't waste your time . overall , 1 out of 10 . i feel sorry for hooper , his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started . i hope that he is able to pump out at least one more good flick , that way he can do his cult status some justice .",0,1
"a neat 'race against time' premise - a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague , so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts , the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them . this movie is freely available from the internet archive and it is well worth downloading . a lot ( all ? ) of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations , which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail , though to me it does look under-exposed , even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then were not what they are . there is also a plenty of location background noise , which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene , anyone ? there are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes , and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting , though the final chase is worth hanging on for . there's not much wrong with the lead actors either : jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic , intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific , while widmark , as he often did , pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time . somebody should remake this - no supernaturals , no mysticism , no special fx , just a good yarn full of character conflict , and a topical theme . another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o'toole , and that is spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark , sleazy , against-the-clock drama . there's even a midget newspaper seller .

"**** includes spoilers **** i've been a horror film fan now for many decades . just when i think i've seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me . i had never seen this film before . it was a treat , off the beaten path too . . . not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either . here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different . the pretty girl is ( gulp ) fearless for a change and saves the men , including the man she loves , from the monster ! how is that for a twist . this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time , no screaming at her own shadow , no fainting from fright , no tripping over a leaf as she runs . this gal was not afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers . not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted . heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors . . . like a regular 1940s version of ripley . no snake , gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal . books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work . see this if you are a fan , like me , of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b/w horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s . and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection .",1,8

"a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me . it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two . we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older , non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults . this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love . in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse . typical plot some may say , but this really was unexpected . i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship , seeing my own past in their story . moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances . it's a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love . great movie . i'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection .",1,8
"this movie was for a while in my collection , but it was not before a friend of mine reminded me about it until i decided that i should watch it . i did not know much about close to leo just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic aids . although the person who has aids is leo the scenario wraps around the way in which marcel ( the youngest brother of leo ) coupes with the sickness of his relative . at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young marcel . i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . with exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from marcel , they have left quite an impression for me the way they supported their son even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness . the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families i know will be reluctant to do that . there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together you can see them being real friends , concern about each other . close to leo is an excellent drama , which i strongly recommend",1,8
"madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today . celebrities party endlessly , they like to be seen at these parties , and to get due exposure in the media . in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this . imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a ""i need you , you need me"" kind of relationship . however , the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa . anyhow , in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column ( page 3 of the newspaper ) reporter konkana sen sharma . she is shown as this celebrity maker , very popular at the social gatherings . she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit ( bikram saluja ) . she rooms with an air-hostess the sassy pearl ( sandhya mridul ) , and a struggling actress - gayatri ( tara sharma ) . the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni . the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level . the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part , the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios , exploitation of power , hunger for media exposure . into all this is layered in homosexuality , a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot , rampant drug use , pedophilia , police ""encounter"" deaths . in light of all this pearl's desire to have a super rich husband , a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car , the bitching women , all seem benign ills . the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma , atul kulkarni has almost no role a pity in my opinion . but the supporting cast is more than competent ( boman irani is very good ) . this is what saves the film for me . mr . bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash . i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively . he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful . we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party , the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat . i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients . the film is a brave ( albeit flawed ) effort , certainly worth a watch .",1,8
"this film does not fail to engage and move , even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques . the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience . one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has . silent film making was pure art , it had to hold the attention through its structure , direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions . a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable . this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes . this is not a 'christiany' film , it is not selling anything . these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on sundays was a national past time , christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then . the themes would have rung true and deep at the time . it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie ( and it is not preaching religion to anyone , only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest ) that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality , along with some other individuals he named . ny times 1922 . maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and , learned some lessons . the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500 , 000 . the film representative in the debate however made the following observations; that saloon attendance had also dropped , that there were far more pastors in prison than actors ( fact ) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole . thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film . this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices . mary pickford , naive , honest , feisty , full of happiness and joy , faithful , humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character . this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film . this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly , languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character . it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section . the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound , running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing . it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you have not hear a word spoken , but it feels like you have heard everything . the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope , jean hersholt and lloyd hughes . the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow , a near perfect balance and ending . this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated . chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford . another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored , with the actors over-exposure . that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still could not get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability .",1,10
"a truly disturbed , cannibalistic psychopath , john ( gary kent , under the pseudonym michael brody ) who lives in a cave , stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness . steve ( dean russell ) and his buddy charlie ( john batis ) get into a playful argument with their wives , sharon ( tomi barrett , the late real-life wife of gary kent ) ) & teddi ( ann wilkinson ) over surviving in the woods camping by themselves . to prove a point , the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of los angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward . falling prey to john , teddi is soon killed as sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating . afraid , tired , and paranoid , sharon receives some very unusual assistance . . john's ghost children ! that's right , john's children remain in the wilderness , ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods , taking a special liking to sharon , helping guide her to safety and her friends . meanwhile , steve and charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where john lives . cooking over a burning fire , the meat simmering is actually from charlie's wife , teddi ! unknowingly charlie eats from the meat when offered by john who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place ! anyway , soon , worried about their wives , steve and charlie set out to find them as morning breaks . meanwhile , john goes a hunting , with charlie , steve , and sharon in a fight for survival . when steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river , he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario , with sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety . . they even , at one point , plead with their father to not kill her . charlie , unfortunately , does not have such friends . director donald jones ( . . who also wrote it and went broke funding the film ) smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking , gorgeous location in the sequoia national park , in california , where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights , and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose . for some strange reason , i did not particularly find jones' direction of the setting very atmospheric . . the dread was missing , although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knife ( . . shot in a clever way , jones' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen , yet , somehow , still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims ) . within such a picturesque landscape , to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac , that kind of increases the terror . city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place , to smell the clean , fresh air , enjoy the sights of a lovely view , only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife . providing the back-story to why john is the monster he is , jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly ( . . she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children , wishing to punish them for ""being naughty"" ) killing both her and the lover in bed ( . . a refrigerator repairman ) . the children , sad and depressed committed suicide and now ""haunt"" the wilderness , still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose . i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some , but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious . they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations , but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably . the music i found hideously 80's and the performances are not mind-blowing . i mean i could react to the situation they were in , because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well . i think the film is similar in many ways to don't go into the woods . . alone ! , except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost children ( . . their voices echo when talking to sharon , their father , or each other ) . gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas , with tattered clothes , and humanity lost . as i mentioned above , the violence is not as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration , yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled ( . . such as teddi's murder , the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation , her pleas for john to stop and , once stabbed several times , attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off;a hanging corpse john is skinning ) . i've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film , it is rather mediocre , at best , with some effectively shot scenery . i do not really think it is particularly memorable , for the exception of the ghost children .",0,4
"i'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer , i just think this is a silly one . after a long waiting time , i watched it at last and here's my comment . . . i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it , instead of it my first applause goes to acting , generally that japanese movies has not got brilliant and acting . yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it , especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well , i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones , as for hyde part , his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor , respectively as his character do , throughout the movie . i did not like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget , it still has brilliant moments , but the real jewel of the film is story . it has some cheesy moments but it is ok for me , and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes , on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals . an interesting note aside , this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful ( not handsome , beautiful ) actors of american cinema , actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew , yet original on it is own . only problem that moonchild is it is a bit slow sometimes , i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it is not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters . but all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes , as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future , and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10",1,8

"i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market , and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor . i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static-induced headache increased . i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief . even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by michael keaton , i was totally unaffected by his demise . up until the credits i diligently awaited for something--anything-- of substance to connect me to the characters' story , but such relief never came . sure , there were the occasional heart-stopper moments , but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer . while the acting was lame , michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date . perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton's abodes . overall , white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows , contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves .",0,1
"when sam peckinpah's superlative the wild bunch ( 1969 ) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence , it did so with a talented ( if whisky-marinated ) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth , but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah's epic , and soldier blue definitely falls into that category . soldier blew , er , blue tells the story of foul-mouthed new yorker cresta lee ( candice bergen ) a blonde proto-hippie chick who is been ""rescued"" from two years of ""captivity"" among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she will be reunited with the fianc e she only wants to marry for his money . also on board the wagon she is traveling in is a shipment of government gold , cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with , so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills , accompanied by honus gant ( peter strauss ) , the lone surviving cavalryman . calling gant by the snarky nickname ""soldier blue , "" cresta demonstrates that her years among the ""savages"" was time well spent , outstripping gant in survival skills , common sense , and sheer balls , and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements , a band of hostile kiowa , an unscrupulous trader played by donald pleasance , here giving one of his most ridiculous performances , and that is saying something and , in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies , each other . during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably and predictably attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on while gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg , no less in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was not filled with rattlesnakes , mountain lions , or who knows what , to say nothing of the cheyenne , who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment ( there i go , thinking in nyc real estate terms again ) . realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave , cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge will not spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village , and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what is coming . what happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre , an orgy of rape , torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of ""keeping the country clean , "" and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets , unarmed people are beheaded a nice effect , i have to admit women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes , then raped and mutilated in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight , so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts , which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered , their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . no joke , this scene would instantly garner an nc-17 rating if released today , to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted . i'm all in favor of westerns that do not shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won , or stolen if truth be told , but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it is a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up ( well , duh ! ) , then it is a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho ( with no undies ) , but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere , all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film , but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery . but by trying to be all things to all audiences , soldier blue ends up as an incoherent , preachy mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness , but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre , would not it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece ?

"anna christie ( 1931 ) on its own terms , this version of garbo's anna christie , shot a year later in german with a whole new cast , is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the english version ( both are american mgm productions ) . garbo is if anything more commanding ( or more beautiful as a screen presence ) and her acting is more restrained . and she seems frankly more at ease , probably for a lot of reasons , but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture , so had adjusted quickly . without comparing always one film to the other , this anna christie is still the same o'neill play with too many words . his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here , but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway . there are some scenes missing--the coney island section is shortened and is not as good--but overall it is a direct echo of the first film . the director , jacques feyder ( belgian-french ) , is simply redoing what was done already , which i assume must be a frustrating experience . it's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way ( not only the sets , but the shots , are all the same ) . there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm , understandably , but also a brief scene where marie dressler ( from the english language version ) is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal , drunk as can be . but they are just silhouettes , and when the next scene shows their faces , we see the german actors taking their parts . there is no replacing dressler , for sure , but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance . clearly the themes--immigration , wayward fathers , daughters turning to prostitution , and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then , especially with european threads ( garbo , appropriately , plays a swedish young woman ) .",1,7
"my father , dr . gordon warner ( ret . major , us marine corps ) , was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese , and also received the navy cross . i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then , as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life . my father is a fanatic of facts and figures , and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that . he currently lives in okinawa , japan , married to my mother for over 40 years ( ironically , she is japanese ) , and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii . my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine , you are always a marine . and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much . i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it . and i'd love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year !",1,10

"george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch . but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey , where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit , half animal and half man wendigo , haunts a small town . . . ""wendigo"" by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama . the acting is great , the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments . the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined , or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head . overall , ""wendigo"" is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely will not be the last . give this film a chance , if you do not mind watching something unconventional . 8 out of 10 .",1,8

"bo derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years and that is how it should stayed ! john derek was a competent actor but , as a director , he is virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit , considering that bo ( atypically sporting dark hair ) was only 16 when the film was made ! john also wrote and photographed it; the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious ! the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo's family : they grew up as brother and sister but , now in their teens , the couple discover they are attracted to one another ( but , as i said , do not expect any sexual fireworks ! ) . still , the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view ( which , of course , it does at the finale ) ; derek's is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub ! ! for the record , the couple are married by the end of the film . also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo ( and who , naturally , incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten ) . occasionally , for no very good reason , we are even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles ( among the titles shown is the public enemy [1931] ) ! at the end of the day , while bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming , it is not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness .",0,1
"considering the lack of art with in african cinema ( or black american cinema ) . the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers . but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short . but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking . the genre is unique and not the typical expectation . it is almost this departure which first catches the eye , so watching it twice is critical . the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema . and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare . the film does not copy to attain its message , it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes ( not racial but character based stereotypes ) , from a writers perspective the film is brilliant . it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development . it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly . the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended . but considering the director , owen alik shahadah's last venture 500 years later , music is to be expected . but from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problem brilliant stuff !",1,10
"this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen . the close-up can be a very powerful shot , but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups , it loses all its impact . tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with , the backdrops of mexico , the cantinas , the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives , and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge . unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big , giant head . even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close-up . the score is over-dramatic and intrusive , dictating every emotion we should feel . the story itself should have been handled much better . among other things , too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along - it is just bad writing . it's a typical thriller storyline , but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it . costner's no way out had a somewhat similar storyline , but it was a much better movie . the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film . this movie was never going to be great , but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable .",0,1

"revenge is one of my favorite themes in film . moreso , ""the futility of revenge"" is one of my favorite themes in film . having seen gaspar noe's irreversible ( 2002 ) , i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme . instead , this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus . *spoilers* the end scene , a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene , came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy . however , the film does not even follow through with this . instead , the drawn out scene ( which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized ) is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or ""this did not fix anything"" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background . my problem with the scene was not one of shock , but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience . i mean , do we feel bad for the rapist ? do we rejoice in dawson's revenge ? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all ? do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity ? aside from this failing , the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance . character's are thin , dialog is monotonous , etc . normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent did not really seem to know what those were . thumbs down .",0,3

"this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man . it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things , parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it is not really made very clear . the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they are herded around outside in little yellow jackets . the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory , and talking with his crew as he does so . this is a world of relentless industrialization . it's a relief at least to know these soulless images are not going to be presented without a human voice , as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry , 'our daily bread . ' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town ( many towns , really ) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever , with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is . some of these scenes , the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places , might have been shot memorably by the premier engag photographer sebasti o salgado . but this photographer is not as interested in seeing people up close . his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold , neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz . all this happens in china , of course , though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh . it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive . there are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew ? it is not made clear . edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer . we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow . the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted , and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring . he admits himself that he takes no political stand . when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler , burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification , and hence falsification . but he is showing us places that , if we look closely , reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be . logically , but not entirely fortunately , it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites . burtynsky's ""epiphanies"" may have inspired his decades of fine work , but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we are changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil , which will run out; that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late , and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel . the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it . the reasons for watching it are two : to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials , the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast , awesome , daunting , and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china . because of the limitations of the narration , the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed . it even seems a misnomer . new landscapes they are , but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than ""manufactured . "" 'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles . there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions .",1,7

"it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick . i laughed through the entire picture , as did my entire family . the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--i'll bet they had a good old time while making it . of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great--and how about those everly sisters , each of the two falco's , and the divine music throughout . rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver , and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic . not to mention gregory hines , burt reynolds , the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references . paul anka was his usual entertaining self , with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his ""my way"" welcome home to vick performance . i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends; dreyfuss imitated him well . i am also of the opinion that no one , of any age , would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie--it is a joke--not a terrifying ""gangsta"" film . the cars and clothing were impressive , as was the decorative , ""vic's place .

"why every horror director wants to imitate ""the exorcist"" is a complete riddle to me , as william friedkin's ""classic"" is a very overrated film and , in my opinion , not all that tense or shocking . and yet here's another clean rip-off , a spanish one this time , that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family . paul naschy ( who i must admit looks quite hot here ) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend . at first the priest does not believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted , leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable . . . ""exorcism"" is not only very unoriginal , it is also an insufferably boring film ! here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore , and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep ! the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments , albeit very stupid , and there is quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze . the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money . this is just an awful film , end of story . other european ""the excorcist"" rip-offs are ""the antichrist"" and ""beyond the door"" and they suck as well !",0,2
"i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku , but she only has a smaller part in it , and her character is not very likable . however , the main character , played by melissa sagemiller , is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie . this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent . she does a very good job . the story itself is , on the face of it , pretty nonsensical . after a car crash , some friends are possibly dead , but keeps on living their previous lives , while all sorts of mysterious things happen . some bad guys are after them , but we never really find out who they are ( possibly they were the ones in the other car , but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are after them ) . the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious , but i cannot get anything coherent out of it . the opening scene , where the bad guys ( who wear some strange masks ) cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on . unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull cassie ( sagemiller ) back from the dead . . . but no , that does not seem to work . the bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting . in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice , who the hell needs bad guys ? 3 out of 10 .",0,3
"this film had a great cast going for it : christopher lee , dean jagger , macdonald carey , lew ayres -- solid b-movie actors all . but this downer of a movie did not use any of them to any sort of advantage , with none of their characters even meeting on screen ( though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes ) . the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat . first , they just want to repair their ship and leave , then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need . then , out of nowhere , this ""peaceful"" race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many ""diseases"" ( though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society ) . most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing . you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end , just in vengeance for boring us to death . unless you really like chris lee or seventies low-budget sci-fi , i'd give this one a miss . it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo : target earth .",0,1
"some people loved ""the aristocrats"" and others hated it , frequently walking out in the middle . reactions to eddie izzard are not likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian ( who says he likes girls ) and has a vocabulary that makes , shall we say , enough use of the ""f"" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television . many of izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances . on the other hand , i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and , in spots , absolutely hilarious . he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines . he's not a story teller . he's not a joke maker . he's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams . he plays around with ideas , some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz , for instance -- are completely unfunny . he has a way , however , of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect . i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 . but a 10 ? no way .",1,7
"julian noble ( pierce brosnan ) is a hit-man . or a ""facilitator of fatalities"" , as he prefers to be called . he is also a drunk , a womaniser , and in the middle of a mid-life crisis . on a job in mexico city , he bumps into danny white ( greg kinnear ) , an unconfident businessman who thinks he is just nailed a recent pitch , but is unsure . they meet in the hotel bar late one night , after they have both had a few too many margaritas . sounds like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller , does not it ? but it is not . instead , the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study . it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest , sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down . it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it , without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances . brosnan's hit-man will inevitably be compared to his bond , but this is unfair to both performances . bond is a half-formed idea , a product of all that has gone before; while julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws . he has existed in his own shadowy , seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being . when he meets danny in the hotel bar , he sees his opposite : a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems . he envies danny; the hit-man has become fed up with his life , sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable ""burn out"" , as he puts it . but when danny opens up about the death of his only son , julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke . he is a man who has , in his own words , been ""running from any emotion . "" kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan's performance , and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm . he is the perfect foil to julian; while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism , danny is down to earth , with just a hint of eccentricity . but he too goes deeper than his established persona , showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin . there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear . it is most visible in the film's three key scenes : the hotel bar; a bullfight , during which julian tells danny what he does for a living , and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination; and a scene in which julian turns up at danny's house six months later . this scene also introduces us properly to danny's wife , bean ( yes , bean ) . in another example of how much the matador respects its characters , bean ( hope davis ) , instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house , merely asks with forced calm , ""did you bring your gun ? "" the script is not quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite . one or two lines seem a little forced , and a couple of the jokes need a little more work . but in the scenes where julian and danny ( and later bean ) just talk , the writing is superb . the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations ( other than meeting a hit-man , and said hit-man turning up on your doorstep ) . it just lets them talk , gently nudging them toward necessary plot points . there is action , but only when it reflects on the characters . one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope . the rest of the film is about the characters , how they interact , how they each affect one another . and , ultimately , it is about friendship , even in the most unlikely of places . at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend . and he really means it .",1,7
"this complicated story begins fairly simply , with an english journalist accepting a wager from edgar allen poe and his friend lord blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted blackwood castle . once there , the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors , until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room . he sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard , and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth blackwood . she informs him with an ambiguous charming/eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night . . . the night of the dead . thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night . spoiler ahead : it probably will not surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely elizabeth is actually a ghost . this does not prevent her from falling in love with the journalist , but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple . this is a fun movie , with absolutely everything : ghosts , the spooky castle , repeated visions of past events , sex and violence ( though both have been toned down in the version most americans have seen over the years . ) the alluring , captivating barbara steele is the main reason to see it . she has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you have ever seen in the movies . recommended !",1,7

"this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . but this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . screenplays not always need be 'chatty' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . here one line attempts such as ""he just took off"" or ""i know you do not have love in heart"" just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time . also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . talk about trying to hard . if you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .",0,1
"unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would have chosen it . this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance . carol burnett , albert finney , tim curry , bernadette peters , edward hermann , the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn , and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston ( father of actress angelica huston ) is what made this film so charming . even the 1999 remake with kathy bates , victor garber , alan cumming , and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel . before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains . she had a few bit parts in movies but i do not know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own . and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom , ridiculous ! they could not get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks , miss hannigan , and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady ? it does not surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was . the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie , even if it was only made for tv , it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie .",0,1

"''ranma "" is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi . the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story , that is not only a comedy , but also an action anime . the main character of the story is ranma saotome , a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts . ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers , who are great friends and trained together during many years . akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's : kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what . ranma and akane fight all the time , specially because both have a very bad temper , and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda , many new characters and situations starts to happen . they also discover the reason of the transformation : while fighting , ranma and his father fell in a cursed river . but not only them had this kind of fate . . . if you watched ''ranma 1/2'' and liked , i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku"" , two other good creations from rumiko's hands .",1,8
"i come to pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here . i'm relatively new to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us . so i do not have a broad basis for comparing pinjar to other indian films . luckily , no comparison is needed . pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece . in one line i can tell you that pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time . on a mass-appeal scale , it *could* have been the indian equivalent of ""crouching tiger , hidden dragon"" had it been adequately promoted in the us . this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map . the american movie-going public has a long-standing love affair with ""gone with the wind"" , and while pinjar does not borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities . not the least of which is the whopping ( by us standards ) 183-minute run time . set against the gritty backdrop of the india-pakistan partition in 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating . put into an untenable position , she somehow manages to not only survive , but to grow -- and even flourish . if the story is lacking in any way , it is in the exposition . puro's ( the protagonist ) growth as a person would be better illustrated -- at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture -- if her character's ""back story"" were more fully developed in the early part of the film . but that would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or perhaps even more . because not one minute of the film is wasted , and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time . better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains . i could use many words to describe pinjar : ""poignant"" , ""disturbing"" , ""compelling"" , ""heart-wrenching"" come to mind immediately . but ""uplifting"" is perhaps as apropos as any of those . any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such . and puro's triumph -- while possibly not immediately evident to those around her -- is no less than inspirational . for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enough . equally inspiring is urmila matondkar's portrayal of puro . all too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger , newer actresses , urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays . she does not merely act puro's part , she breathes life into the character . manoj bajpai's selection as rashid was inspired . he manages something far too few indian film heroes can : subtlety . his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role . he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword-wielding rioters combined . if you only see one bollywood film in your life , make it pinjar .",1,10
"well , magic works in mysterious ways . this movie about 4 prisoners , trying to escape with the help of spells , written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense . even if it had something of a theater-play ( almost everything happens in the cell ) it never got boring and it was acted very well . in the tradition of ""cube"" you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal , you developed some sympathy with some of them , only to change your mind by the twists the story takes . some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air . altogether intense and entertaining and as i did not expect anything ( a friend rented it ) , it was a positive surprise !",1,8

"one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy . the other films in polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too , but they are all different in what makes them creepy , but they all roughly deal with the same thing , they all deal with the mind . definitely the staring people are very creepy , each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still . again , if you have seen the other two films mentioned , i'm sure you will find this quite creepy , because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto , he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things , personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump , maybe that is just me , but it felt intended to do that , though it was quite subtle , there is no build up of the music in those moments . the acting in this was pretty good , mostly that from polanski of course , the other characters in the film do not have all that much time to outshine the lead . polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker , he not only can direct and write great films , but he can actually act too . i do not think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character , polanski settled right on in perfectly . i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast , to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent , which i respect greatly . one thing i did not like about this film is how it was done in english . for those who do not know , this is a french film , american financed , and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english . there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing , and i do not know why it is , but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub . there is a women in the film who when she speaks it is obvious it is a dub , but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over , it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak , she had the loudest high pitch voice i've heard in a while , it almost seemed fake , but i do not see what the point was , she was a rather small character . i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed , parts of it in french and parts of it in english , because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near ( two completely different films , i know ) the high standard of another film that did a similar thing , which was , the good , the bad and the ugly . i realise it is not a big problem , just when you do realise it , it gets annoying , but i'm sure you will not sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying , regardless if you know french . whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him , that you know his style , which in some aspects you do , but really , you cannot see whats behind that corner . this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned , which i think really strengthens this one in particular . i personally feel this is the best of the three , i'm unsure which comes next , but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness . the ending is fantastic , it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere . i choose not to think to much on it , just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that . i've rambled on , and i have not really given any insight on what makes this film so great , i do not think , so i'll quickly do it here . if you liked repulsion and/or rosemary's baby , i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least . for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent , particularly the end , as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind , paranoia even , though that is better fitted under repulsion .",1,8
"i thoroughly enjoyed bilal's graphic novel when it came out , and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film , and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself . the film , however , was a major letdown . the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks , and the story is poorly told . bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel , and he does not do a very good job at it , either . the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between nikopol and horus . they were both out of their right time and place , forced together by circumstance . most of all , they were funny and likable . not so here . nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever , and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid . even though the film is french , horus does not have to be ! we have all seen films we enjoyed , but would not recommend to everyone , for some reason or other . i would not recommend immortel to anyone , except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources . bilal's a master storyteller , but obviously not a master of every visual medium .",0,4

"taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway , walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics , a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life . walter matthau cannot stop working , the man has never learned to relax , take some time and smell the roses . he's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him . what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family . a workaholic like matthau cannot comprehend it and take burns's decision personally . benjamin hits on a brain storm , reunite the guys and do it on a national television special . what happens here is pretty hilarious . the sunshine boys is also a sad , bittersweet story as well about old age . matthau is on screen for most of the film , but it is burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79 . burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well . as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burns&allen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from . in 1958 due to health reasons , gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 . or at least pretty close to as an active performer . the sunshine boys is based on the team of smith&dale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century . the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their material . and i do think you will like the sunshine boys .",1,9

"if your idea of a thriller is car chases , explosions , and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire , then ""house of games"" is definitely not the movie for you . if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense , then , by all means , see it . ""house of games"" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer , dr . margaret ford ( lindsay crouse ) , who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike ( joe mantegna ) . to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . frankly , i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . just like a clever con artist , this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance . the story is taut and well-crafted , the dialogue smart and laconic , the acting uniformly good ( mantegna is superbly charismatic ) . some have complained that dr . ford is not a very sympathetic character , and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive . but dr . ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover , her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot ( at one point , i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation . . . i'll say no more ) . ""house of games"" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . it will hold your attention every second while you are watching , and stay with you for a long time afterwards .",1,8
"this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver's license . it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars . such things as dune buggies , drag racing , custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed . it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull , drawn out and even sexist at times . none of the people in the film are actually heard . instead , everything is done in narration and voiceovers . sorry , but i cannot stand that . there is nothing educational or interesting about ""dad , can i borrow the car ?

"like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons , this movie has humor at different levels . i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son . both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times . . . and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan . the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times . . . the adult-level humor ( that is , humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences , no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here ) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults . for example of the adult level humor , the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors . the martian pilot , blaznee , has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson; the scientist , that of peter seller's dr . strangelove . the special effects are surprisingly good for this film . the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor , and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power ( an excellent example is wayne alexander's ""vern"" character ) . i had to write this review . . . the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now . good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there is-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie .",1,8
"william cooke and paul talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines . feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth . . . and a scroungy town tramp named ralph ( gunnar hansen . . . of leatherface fame ) wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire . one tale is the old retread of ""the hook"" , two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand . another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed . they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t . as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off . one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas , who cannot wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus . the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies . without a big budget for special effects , campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse . a bit corny , but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale . the acting is understandably not award worthy . cast members include : tres holton , courtney ballard , h . ray york , johnny tamblyn , walter kaufmann , kevin draine , david avin and paul kaufmann .",0,4

"revolt of the zombies ( 2 outta 5 stars ) no , this is not a long-lost ancestor to the classic george a . romero zombie flicks . this is a low-budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time . . . but seems awfully routine these days . there is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers . . . and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them . the effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 i'm sure it had audiences gasping . the story concerns the search for the secret of mind control . . . ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army . . . but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves . the movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail's pace so it seems feature-length , believe me ! there really is not much to recommend it . . . you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star ""wading"" through a ""swamp"" . the ending is interesting . . . so i'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once . more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap ""4 movies on 1 dvd"" compilation at wal-mart for five bucks . hey , it is well worth the money . . .",0,4

"who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother , could possibly be good cinema ? i certainly did not . i thought i knew what to expect : one of the most boring experiences of my life . well i was as wrong as i have not been wrong too often yet , because this is one of the best , most realistic and honest hollywood films i've ever seen . . . giving a short resume of ""the straight story"" is not very difficult . it's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke . that's already special on itself , but what makes it even more special is the fact that he has not seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument . in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems , but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life . despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks , not knowing if he will reach his goal : seeing his brother again before it is too late . . . i can easily understand why there are people who do not like this movie and that is also the reason why i will not say that these people do not have a heart or things like that . . . this movie has not got any flashy action scenes , it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no , you do not have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either , because there is not any . but why should you watch it then ? well , the simple answer is the story . i have not seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and - to make things even better - from the disney studio's ( that is right , the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense ) makes it even more special . i'm not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it , probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me . some people will argue that the story is very shallow , but i really do not agree with that . perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and do not want to think any further . if you look close enough than you will understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong , that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too , so they will not make the same mistake . if that is not deep enough , how much deeper does a story have to go for you then ? i would also like to add that this movie really had it all . some beautiful landscapes ( finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york , chicago or some other big city ) , some very fine acting by richard farnsworth , sissy spacek , . . . and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie . i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie would not be to my taste . it's one of the very best movies i've seen in a long time . this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye . i give it the full 10/10 .",1,10

"despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes . where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants ? not on the payroll apparently . a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes . in a later conversation she said , ""imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates . worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo . maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was ""missing the hoop"" or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair , but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears . . . . and be laughing in the aisles . . . excellent story and photography be damned . so . . . watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances , actual geisha or japanese dress , and that was the topic of the movie ! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making . they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong . i thought ""the last samurai"" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be . memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time .",0,3
"it's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best , ' whether of all time , a certain genre , or what have you , but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact , laputa is the greatest animated film ever made . it is in my mind the masterwork of hayao miyazaki , the most talented of japan's animated directors , and it best captures his strengths as a director , storyteller , and designer , as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes . the version i'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub ( i know , sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language ) ; there is at least one other english language dub out there , i have it on vhs ( i have no idea from what source ) , and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film . but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find . laputa tells the story of a boy named pazu ( voiced by james van der beek here ) , who is growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named sheeta ( anna paquin ) literally drops from the sky . it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent , colonel muska ( mark hamill ) , who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck . to keep things lively , there is also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal , led by the aging but still boisterous dola ( cloris leachman ) . the plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of laputa , a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure . it's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting , but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story , and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature . the design work on laputa , nearly twenty years later , is still revolutionary . flying machines of all sorts abound , utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking . the world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century , with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines . but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; laputa is both the garden of eden and the fire of heaven itself , and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal , its power , and its danger . besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film , laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography . from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water , laputa displays a scope that most films even with the magic of cgi can only daydream about . though we only see a small fraction of this world , its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it . the film also contains one of my favorite , if not the most exciting , action sequences ever : a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in , all the while trying to protect sheeta ( who was the one who woke it up ) . meanwhile , pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her , literally , from the jaws of destruction . from the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue , the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience . it helps that laputa has an amazing score . composer joe hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world , the dewy innocence , the exciting action , and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians . though he re-recorded it for this dvd release ( which imo is not an improvement over his original score ) , adding pieces here and there , the score matches the visuals perfectly , a rare total union of sound and vision . this is not a bad dub . i'm inordinately fond of the older english dub , and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots , but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those ( and those matched the japanese pretty well ) . dola in particular is hard to get right , but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman ( her sons are not quite as good as the original ) . paquin does a good job as sheeta , and mark hamill , while i knew it was him early , is more than talented enough to do muska ( i liked the other english dub of muska a little more , but hamill's good ) . much of the film rests on pazu's shoulders , and van der beek is wonderful . listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub , because vdb matches up very closely with the original pazu . although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful , as much as i love this film , i do not think you are sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular anglicized version . john lassiter of pixar introduces it up front , and my suspicion is that he , like so many others , simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality . miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and mononoke ( one of his few films i did not care for ) , but to me laputa is still his crowning achievement . anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work , and again , this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder . i'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen , it is good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on dvd .",1,10
"there's no romance or other side plot to this movie , it is action and intrigue all the way , making it a real man's kung-fu movie . an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who is styles represents five venomous animals centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard and the toad . despite the word ""venom"" in the title , none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents . yan tieh told by his teacher that he is no match for the five former pupil , must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four . how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story , with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story . recognized as a cult classic , this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies . it's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story . it's no artistic masterpiece , with the usual bad dubbing , and corny acting , but the movie is one of the best of its kind , because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time , and gives an extra concentrated dose of them . one movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan .",1,7

"ok i'm not an american , but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not , never has been , and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction . phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man , no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced . how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me . to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin's unfunny attempt to be peter seller's inspector clouseau , another abortive attempt , in my opinion , to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career . some of your contributers say 'steve martin puts his own stamp on the character' , to that i would say 'balderdash' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come",0,2
"i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy . the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects . what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget , locally produced ( valley forge pa ) christian shorts . let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious . that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits . for what it was meant to be , this film is excellent . i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts , blair witch project was one of them , that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot . bwp was pure excrement . the blob , on the other hand , was well thought out , well scripted , and thoroughly entertaining . the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy . the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece . bottom line is , i love this movie . i challenge anyone out there to take $120 , 000 . 00 , inflated for today's dollar value , and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob . it just cannot be done . period ! thank you for taking time to read this review .",1,10

"this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's . but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves . the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer . this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws . the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david's second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba . hayward is at her best in this film . her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here . she is ever the seductress , but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her . raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet . as a child when i first saw the film , massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight . no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like ""the robe"" and ""the greatest story ever told"" along with perhaps 100 other films too ! the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film . henry king , a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon-holed himself into any one genre , pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david's own deep struggle with his faith in god . the path tread in this film could have been very hokey , but king keeps it real and interesting all the way . plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god , just as david himself is struggling with the same . from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction . david is not satisfied with nathan's answer , ( to paraphrase ) that no one can understand the will of god . this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself . finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david . his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms . this is one of his best performances . i do not see this movie on television much anymore , but when i do i never fail to watch it . i think it still holds up very well today .",1,10
"have you ever felt like your being watched , like someone keeps tabs on every move you make ? well , just remember before you decide to break the law , the fbi will always be there . at least that is the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama , the fbi story . it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world ( in 1959 ) , by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents , chip hardesty ( james stewart ) . chip was with the fbi from day one , and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world , even occasionally his family . the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent , and how being one affects his personal life . the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them . the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots , go undercover to solve an indian murder/estate scandal , bring fugitives into custody , rescue hostages , and helped fight in wwii . he even helped bring communist spies to justice . stewart , in a vaguely complex performance , is stellar ( as always ) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much . one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip's family life and his job . we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son . we also observe his wife having a miscarriage , and his marriage having rocky times . almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job . vera miles gives a spotty performance , but it is very convincing , none the less . she was never a brilliant actress , but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her . well maybe that is just me ? sadly , none of the other performances are worth mentioning , but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested . the cinematography of this film was impressive , especially the scenes in the south american jungles . the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film . perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy's fabulous direction . every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story . it's chock full of ingenious camera shots , some with a very hitchcockian feel . all in all , the fbi story is a spectacular , but overlooked film . clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated , but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one . i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance , and the captivating story .",1,8

"the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds , and looks more like caricatures rather than characters . i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 . i did not think much of the scooby doo animated movies , ( i'm talking about the tv series , not the full length movies . ) , but some of them were pretty cool , and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant , but this series is pure garbage . as soon as i saw the animation , and heard the characters , ( and i use that term loosely ) speak , i cringed . also , mystery inc . , was a team , and without the entire crew to compliment each other , it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones , and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants . what's new scooby doo was better than this . if you are going to have a scooby doo tv series , include the elements that made the series endure so long . the entire cast of characters , and quality animation . they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came .",0,1
"a christmas together actually came before my time , but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music . for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas . a few years ago , i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay , so after listening to all the music for some 21 years , i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself . if you ever get the chance , it is a lot of fun--great music , heart-warming and cheesy . it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today . i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--i guess normally performers do not compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the muppets , but i'm glad he did . even if you cannot track down the video , the soundtrack is worth it too . it has some muppified traditional favorites , but also some original denver tunes as well .",1,8
"nope , i am just not going to get with it here . i refuse to go along with the program . don't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over-rated ? look at the reader comments and their star ratings : most are 6/10 , 7/10 or better . i think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself , which is unique . how many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog dvd titles ? i watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation , expecting fireworks , and instead got someone popping a gucci shopping bag . it looked great , but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending did not do much to save it . the film's background story says it all : director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie , is informed the footage will not be appropriate , sets it aside , waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up , then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes , filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated , excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence . that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd , original and shocking in a deliberate , calculated manner goes without saying . but we are not here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone , we must consider the entire film , and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie ? or are they just enamored by it is background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it ? perhaps it is an anti-clerical agenda that appeals to them . hating the western religions of catholicism and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- just today it was revealed that the bbc routinely skews their broadcasts with anti christian & anti western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness . you can say anything you want about the bible , pedopheliac priests , the institutionalized cruelty of the church , and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball . . . but say one negative thing about non-westernized religions , and you are toast . this movie was tailor made for such a sentiment , with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching , fawning , fondling , fumbling , groping , and patting of the backsides . ewww . and then there is the horse couplings , photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry . yes i understand the thematic relevance of the imagery -- large animal phallus's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers -- but if i wanted to watch horses , you know , do it , i would like go live on a farm . having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom . is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants ? probably , though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it , filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a monet painting , complete with a spanning arched bridge . and the ending ( which even i managed to be surprised by ) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package . but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it . that is not fair , and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about iwo jima . whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes . the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it oscars because of it is noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie . while it may seem like an odd parallel , i see one with the beast : how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating ? and who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set-piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty ? somehow i managed to miss both points , and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is : 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy-fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut , and a great ending . it's art for sure , but it sucks hard . 3/10",0,3
"you do realize that you have been watching the exact same show for eight years , right ? i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an island , but you would think that after watching unkempt , stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original ( and interesting ) . and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable . it's just hard to suspend disbelief for ""bushy bill"" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy . what's the appeal here ? i do not care about these people or their meandering lives . i just do not get it . but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy , unwashed people , i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat . they call them homeless people , and free of charge , you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters , eventually striking ""pay-dirt"" and fashioning a homemade dr . frankenstein-styled cancer-stick , all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of ""aqua velva"" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise . and the best part ? much like survivor , every week one member of the tribe ""leaves"" the ""island"" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear ! now that's entertainment !",0,4

"chang cheh's ""shaolin temple"" might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle . this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who is who of the shaw stable . though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual , it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable . the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame . not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in ""the long gray line , "" cheh's ""shaolin temple"" is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style . the cultural correlation i am tempted to make , is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo . watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo . at the end of the film , you too might be tempted to call out , remember the shaolin temple !",1,9
"i was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the maryland film festival . i've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle , so this was definitely a must-see for me . this is about the life and work of william castle , who in my opinion was an underrated director . true , he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films , but he added something to these films : real live theater gimmicks that you do not see anymore . for example , he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in the tingler . this is truly a well-made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light , and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema . it also paints castle as a larger than life character , who was very well-liked and had a smile on his face . unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians , spine tingler ! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work , such as john waters , john landis , and joe dante . a must see for classic horror and sci-fi fans .",1,10

"i have two good things to say about this film : the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance ( considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction ) . however , that said , i found this film extremely tiresome . watching paint dry would have been more entertaining . it seemed much longer than 97 minutes . beginning with opening sequence , where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that is said to him on the phone , the movie is annoying . the film is filled with clich s and shtick , not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk . also , the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears . there are some sequences that are touching , but they are all played for laughs . if schmaltzy , sentimental , and ""cute"" appeal to you , you will love it . but if you were hoping for something with more substance , see a different movie .",0,3

"every once in a while , a group of friends , with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent , will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm . raimi and co . did it with the evil dead , jackson and pals succeeded with bad taste; and myrick and sanchez made a mint with the blair witch project . director todd sheets and his chums , however , are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if zombie bloodbath is anything to go by . a lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror , this miserable effort ( about a plague of flesh-eating zombies natch ) serves as a reminder that , whilst many people these days have access to a video camera , most should not take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full-length movie . it's not that sheets has not got an eye for a nicely framed shot ( some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good ) , but rather that a ) he has a lousy script b ) he has a lousy cast , and c ) he does not realise that he has a lousy script and cast . which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme , and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists ( like me ) or members of the cast and crew ( like those who have given the film favourable comments ) . zombie bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore-hounds , and sheets ( who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director ) certainly goes out of his way to please , with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity . but whilst these moments are undeniably yucky , they are not particularly convincing , and soon get rather tedious . so , to summarise , this is a really bad film , with almost no redeeming features . except for two : firstly , it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film , as sported by jerry angell , who plays larry ( as well as several zombies ) . the magnificence of his barnet ( coupled with a fetching moustache ) is reason alone to watch this film . secondly , it has 'pathetic stealth zombies' : flesh-eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by , before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack , which requires almost no effort to escape from . best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it , 'pathetic stealth zombies' also occasionally hide behind low walls , or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation . normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me , but , in celebration of jerry angell's flowing locks , i will generously raise my rating to 2/10 .",0,2
"this is the second movie i saw for horrorfest this past weekend , the gravedancers being the first . gravedancers was better . i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited . i will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end . we were not really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying . i have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as sheriff . the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was , which turned out to not be all that interesting . some more background about the family would have helped but they did not really seem like a family at all to begin with . to me , this film is so amateur that i could not even see putting it on dvd . the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had . this was one to skip for horrorfest .",0,4

"i did not think it could be done , but something has come along and replaced open house- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film i've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life . it was touted as the best film in montreal's most recent film festival , which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry . watching this movie was like a little slice of hell . it's from austria , and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly . there's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him , the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child , the ber-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists . . . the list goes on . forever . much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatre . yes , the characters interact , but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way . i could not say if they were any good as actors , as , according to the subtitles , they were given lines that were the austrian equivalent of ""you are so lame ! "" they certainly did not have to learn many , as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene . this is no gummo , or any of the aforementioned movies . there is no art to discover , and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your ""never walk out during a movie"" policy ( which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing , it is not , unless you are one of few who does not find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples , to boot- revolting ) . this movie was offensive to me . not the flabby nudity , not the cringe-inducing soundtrack , not the shockless scenes involving guns . i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding . i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us montrealers could find . most of all , i was offended that , somehow , the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease .",0,1

"guys and dolls is a movie itching for a remake . it was made forty-eight years ago . its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds . although a remake , with big stars now , would be box-office success , it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version . its boundless energy cannot be recaptured , nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this : a huge , widescreen , big entertainment movie . marlon brando ( who last clocked in at 409 lbs . last time i heard ) plays sky masterson , one of the biggest gamblers in new york . frank sinatra is nathan detroit , whose as-often-as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it crap game is city-wide famous . however , when the one place he has left to hold it is charging $1 , 000 , detroit needs the money fast . he bets masterson $1 , 000 that he cannot take missionary sarah brown ( jean simmons ) to havana with him the next day . guys and dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing , which usually , as it does here , add up to fun . it's obvious to see how this was a broadway musical : there were not that many sets , and the scenes were long . if i was to complain about one thing , it is how uneven the songs were . at times , there were two songs in a scene; other times , thirty minutes went by without one . guys and dolls is never boring , just a great time . my rating : 8/10 not rated .",1,8

"what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is ? just one year after ""the breakfast club"" , a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in ""st . elmo's fire"" ( who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles . was it the directing or the writing . since it was the same person ( joel schumacher ) it must be both . but then schumacher has since given us ""the phantom of the opera"" , ""phone booth"" , ""a time to kill"" , and two batman movies , ""batman and robin"" and ""batman forever"" which range from good to great directing . something went wrong on ""stef"" because it has no genius whatsoever , no comedy worth anything , and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life . example : the character wendy ( a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham ) reveals to billy ( an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends , drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe ) that she is still a virgin . billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy ""is not ready"" . wendy , in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends . later in the story , when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together . billy is leaving for new york , deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter , he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect ""going away gift"" from her to him . and wendy , who works as a social worker helping broken families , seems not to be phased at all by this despot . give me a break . the one thing she can only give once , she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends ? schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment . many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue . i suppose some may say that ""that was the 80's"" but i remember it was in the ""80's"" that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out . i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right . as for the technique ( not the story ) , it was terrible as well . it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes . transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense . pick up what is on the editing room floor , put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better . . . but it still is a horrible movie . maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 ( he must have ) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo's fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that is what i really think happened .",0,1

"in the trivia section for pet sematary , it mentions that george romero ( director of two stephen king stories , creepshow and the dark half ) was set to direct and then pulled out . one wonders what he would have brought to the film , as the director mary lambert , while not really a bad director , does not really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel , of which he wrote the screenplay . there are of course some very effective , grotesquely surreal scenes ( mainly involving the sister zelda , likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film ) , and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect . but something feels missing at times , some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king-like atmosphere , which is in this case about as morbid as you are going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in ( who knows if he will save that for his final novel . . . ) as mentioned though , some of the casting is terrific , notably miko hughes as gage creed , the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie , to being a little monster ( i say that as a compliment , of course , especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel ) . and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters , who plays this old , secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone . and applause goes to whomever did the make-up on andrew hubatsek . but there are some other flaws though in the other casting; dale midkiff is good , not great , as the conflicted , disturbed father figure creed , and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just did not work for me at all . in terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces , only a couple really stand-out : a certain plot-thickening moment ( not to spoil , it does involve a cool ramones song ) , and the first visit to the pet sematary ( the bigger one ) , including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining . for the most part it is a very polished directing job , though it could have been made even darker to correspond with the script . if thought out in logical terms ( albeit in king terms ) it is really one of his more effective works of the period . but it does not add up like it could , or should . still , it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .",1,7
"i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it . i did not know anything about the story , the cast , the director , or anything about the film's history . all i knew was it was a highly-acclaimed french film . had i known more , i probably would not have viewed the picture with an open mind . on paper , the premise does not sound interesting to me . had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time , my interest while watching would have been limited . however , not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it . throughout , i had no clue has to where the story would go , what the characters would do , and what the end result would be . it was , if nothing else , not a predictable film . indeed , it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks . telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers . since the lead character is seen in present day , the audience knows she will remain alive . by using the flashback technique , director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage , giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside . a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard-looking face , one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood . instead , denis presents france as a beautiful girl , someone who looks fine on the outside . it could be argued that chocolat is more about france's mother since she is given far more screen time , though i believe it is ultimately about france . to me , what chocolat is really about is how a mother's actions affect her daughter . it is about how parents' behavior stays with their offspring . france is not ruined by her mother's actions in the story , yet her mother's actions clearly made an impression on france . had france not been affected at all by her mother's actions , the flashback aspect would be irrelevant . for a movie that deals with two time periods , the past and the present , chocolat was a very well paced , there were no scene of excess fat . none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place . the film had nice rhythm , the editing crisp , leaving only what was necessary to tell the story . with a well told story , solid editing , and organized directing , chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen . it was responsible for launching claire denis' career and with good reason : it is an incredible directorial debut .",1,8
"the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells , waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair . then our ""hero"" , who is called tenshu , is taken to the chair , he is zapped , and then . . . . he is still ""alive"" . aha ! he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : either we zap you until we have made sure you are actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you"" . our hero says yes to option 2 , and then the actual story commences . he wakes up in a different sort of cell ( very high-tech and very big ) , where he finds another cell-mate , who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride . a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish , as long as it happens within that room . sounds a little suspicious , but the two men accept : what else can they do ? what these two men do not know is that they have been set together , so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them . basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other . sounds weird ? indeed , but there is a greater purpose to all of this . this is the part which should not be revealed , and so it shall remain unrevealed . but fear not , it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie , fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : how long time can you stand being with a man who is an s . o . b . and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest , it sneaks up without you actually knowing it . then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon . the movie is indeed very special , so special that normal cinemas will not view it under normal circumstances . however , the story is fascinating , the music is fantastic , and the actors do their bit ( some more than others ) to make the movie truly unique . if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it , watch it , and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash .",1,7
"regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time ( certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career ) . sherman mccoy ( tom hanks ) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria ruskin ( melanie griffith ) are involved in a hit-and-run . his story is chronicled by another smug guy , reporter peter fallow ( bruce willis ) . well , as i said in my summary . . . what is this movie supposed to be ? it seems to combine comedy , drama , and satire , but it sure does not add up to much . it's undermined by unimaginably loathsome , one-dimensional characters who you would never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life . i'm no big fan of the novel ( i started reading it once , but could not finish it because it was not to my liking ) but it is obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty . i've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail . what a waste . the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic . and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit . bruce willis is badly , badly miscast in the role . what was the thinking there . alas , not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact , being obliged to deliver a lame , heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax . this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce . i liked the assemblage of talent; for that i will give it four out of ten , but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material .",0,4

"why do i like disorganized crime so much ? why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie ? it's kind of hard to explain , but i'll give it a try . first of all , it is very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of ""official"" reviews want you to believe . but then again , that depends entirely on your sense of humour , so there is no sense in arguing about that . often the humour is in the dialogue , and often it is situational comedy . there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck . when the farmer drops them , they just stand there by the road , covered all over with cow s*** or whatever . they are totally unnerved; then , realizing the humour of the scene , they one by one start laughing about themselves , and ruben blades ( as carlos ) , looking ( and certainly smelling ) terrible , nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath ( simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again ! ) . which leads to the second point : the acting . fred gwynne , lou diamond phillips , william russ , ruben blades and corbin bernsen ( okay , the latter overdoes it a bit at times ) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact , you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film . thirdly , there is the plot . jim kouf , the director and screenwriter , is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves . more often than not , there is no real action , and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss ( bernsen ) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually , grudgingly , like each other . the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences , yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details . incidentally , the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across , because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way . therefore , take my advice : watch this film , but if you do not chuckle , grin or smile during the first 10 minutes , forget it - it is not your type of film . ps . the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how , do tell me .",1,10
"i went to see ""evening"" because of the cast . i'd gone to see ""norman's room"" for that reason -- that movie offering diane keaton , leonardo de caprio and , also , meryl streep -- and had loved every minute of it . same for ""the notebook"" even though it was chick-flit lite . and my feeling was , anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave , meryl streep , patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good . instead , i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite , simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material . now i had no problem with the way the film was structured . i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story . . . so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse . but while vanessa's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt ""was a mistake"" was riveting , at times , the part actually showing what that ""past mistake"" was does nothing to clarify the matter . in fact , it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest ""girl meets boy , girl gets boy , girl loses boy"" fashion , and in the most unbelievable , clich d , wrong-headed way possible . and from here be spoilers , so bear that in mind should you continue reading . first of all , claire danes was brutally miscast . not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman , she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting . don't get me wrong , she can be good in the right role -- just not this one . and patrick wilson was miscast , though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off . he'd have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played -- the rich confused wasp -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; he is a bit too wasp-y for that . hugh dancy ? one note -- ""i'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why . "" and the ""why"" ( i'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world , so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know ) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died ( as you knew he would because that is the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties ) so ludicrous , wrong-headed and mishandled , i nearly threw my candy at the screen . as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister , her fear of commitment , her jealousy of her sister's ""perfect life , "" her sister wondering if she is made the right choices , her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend ( which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson , and ebon moss-bachrach might have been a more interesting harris , given his dreamy eyes ) -- anyway , all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's . and in much greater depth . do we really have to present it , again , and all as if it was fresh and momentous ? and to top it off , meryl streep does not even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie , all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions . she is still good , but only because she is meryl , and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup . so to put it simply , this movie has every clich in the ""really meaningful message"" movie book , and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out , again . at two hours long and laced with ""lifetime movie-of-the-week"" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw , it is a complete failure in both the ""meaningful"" and ""moviemaking"" aspects . i give it ""3"" only because of meryl and vanessa . now , if all you require from your films is twadd le , then please set my comments about ""evening"" aside and have the time of your life . but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings , rent ""norman's room"" and find out what truly great acting is .",0,3

"memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie , there is no doubt about that . and the acting is generally excellent , at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted . however , so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully . a small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene ( no this does not spoil anything ) where mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where sayuri lives , on a snowy winter day . the bell she is ringing is a fuurin , or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in japan in the summer ! people in traditional japanese homes did not have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves . ( you may think this is such a trivial detail , but i would equate this to a movie made about america where a christmas wreath is hanging on the door in july and no one thinks anything of it . ) and do not even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha , which is vaguely pan-asian/chinese/kung-fu-ish , and nothing like real thing . i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too . so , i suppose that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in kyoto ( which is what ""miyako"" is ) , then i suppose the more you will enjoy this . i honestly think this movie could have been so much better . . . as it is , it is just another hollywood version of ""exotic japan"" .",0,2

"a film with very little positive to say for it . firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama . besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . i lost count of how many times i had seen ""that"" field at night or that bit of cracked earth . it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience do not know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it is fine . we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late . and on the point of the acre . horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary and also if they are meant to be an acre big then make them so . there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by jefferson the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on ""medication"" . with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? he's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene . bad plinky plonk ""horror"" music fails to add atmosphere . often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre , which is just bad .",0,2
"watching truth about love ( is this a double entendre about the star ? ) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the dvd slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day . and it works for that for that purpose : being a british romantic comedy it is a bit more . the story is a rather simple one about a wife alice ( jennifer love hewitt ) married to an increasingly distant husband sam ( jimi mistry ) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice . his partner archie ( dougray scott ) is fond of both sam and alice , but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship . alice pals with her sister felicity ( kate miles ) , a free love advocate , who encourages alice to have affairs . on valentine's day , after a drinking binge with her sister , alice mails a card to sam signed 'anonymous' as a test to see if sam responds , testing his fidelity . at the same time archie mails a radish seed packet to alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not . both have ex post facto regrets . sam in fact is spending time with a lover katya ( branka katic ) and is indeed cheating on alice . alice arranges assignations with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as 'anonymous' to test his fidelity . the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise ( of sorts ) of the fluffy script . british comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting . perhaps had director john hay elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of pasting a phony accent on jennifer love hewitt the result may have been improved . but in the end this story by peter bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages . one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive . there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor , but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise . grady harp",0,3

"i must say that , looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student , brannagh's version of hamlet is by far the best . his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded . it helps the play come to life on screen , and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching , as we did while studying it , to follow and analyze the text . one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play . i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier , as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare . also , his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text . such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end . all in all , not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare . it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature ph . d to understand and enjoy it .",1,10

"seven pounds , this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the ""i'm going to make you cry"" films . one thing i can give him a ton of credit for , the man can cry . my only thing is , as moving as the story is , will smith has proved time and time again that he can act , so why is he taking this extremely depressing story ? but nevertheless it is still a good movie . i do have to admit it made me cry , but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson , i absolutely love this girl , ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton , i knew this girl was going to go far . she is beautiful , charming , funny and talented , cannot wait to see how much further her career is going to go . but her and will smith , not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would have made this into a great film . two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash , which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died : six strangers and his fianc e . a year after the crash , and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer , tim donates a lung lobe to his brother , ben , an irs employee . six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly . after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations . he finds george , a junior hockey coach , and donates a kidney to him , and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas . two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help . she suggests connie tepos , who lives with an abusive boyfriend . tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish . one night , after being beaten , connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house . she takes her two children and moves in to their new home . having stolen his brother's credentials , and making himself known by his brother's name ben , he checks out candidates for his two final donations . the first is ezra turner , a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano . tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger . ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy . he then contacts emily posa , a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type . he spends time with her , weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer . he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation . seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look , i would just recommend going for the rental vs . the theater . will smith pulls in a good performance , but not his best , just most of the film required him crying in every scene , but the last one with him is a doozy . but i loved the ending , it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted . there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need . although he went a little far , but it was still a beautiful story . 7/10",1,7

"it is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of aids . the projected toll is greatest in sub-saharan africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . christophe honor describes one of the most moving in close to leo , a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common -- the effect of a diagnosis of hiv on a loving close-knit family . when twenty one-year old leo ( pierre mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , tristan ( rodolphe pauley ) and pierrot ( jeremie lippmann ) that he has aids , the family is devastated . out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12-year old marcel ( yannis lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . when leo goes to paris for treatment , he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth . leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting . when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion . although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by lespert and mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . seeing events unfold from the young boy's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the quebecois film leolo and truffaut's the 400 blows . unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids , close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real .",1,8
"there's a major difference between releasing an original , intense , edge-of-your-seat , scary , gore-fest , and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with ""cabin fever"" and simply acted like it . the film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious , fast-acting , flesh-eating disease . it's not long before the friends turn on one another , and can barely stand the sight of one another , much less want to be in the same vicinity as them . as gross as it all sounds , there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked , in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker . unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting , a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue , and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than ( in one instance ) an on-screen appearance by director roth . this is sloppy film-making in several ways ! avoid this time devourer .",0,3

"william castle is notorious among horror fans as the b-grade director of the 1950s and 60s . his gimmicks , his cost-cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary . it comes as no surprise , then , that someone ( jeffrey schwarz , who is made countless documentaries ) would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness . such is ""spine tingler : the william castle story"" . i had a general understanding of who castle was , having seen some of his films over the years . i knew nothing about her personal life , his goals and ambitions . this film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film-making and his contributions to the horror genre . the movie depicts castle as rival to alfred hitchcock , with hitch being the artist who wins praise while castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety , but much less respect . he is an icon to all second-rate directors out there , which is why it is not surprising that john waters is featured prominently in here . ( joe dante and stuart gordon also have sizable roles . ) his gimmicks were what drove his fame , and the documentary takes great pains to explain them , which is crucial for those who are too young to remember . the rudimentary 3-d of ""13 ghosts"" ( see separate review ) , the buzzer in the seat for ""the tingler"" ( see separate review ) , money back guarantees for ""homicidal"" . . . watching these films now outside the theater , we can judge them for their content ( which , personally , i still enjoy ) but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt . the climax of the film is when castle goes from cult director to hollywood producer . having bought the rights to ""rosemary's baby"" , he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release . hoping to direct , he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director roman polanski . while at first disappointed , this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime -- a hugely successful film , and a job he excels at . who better to control the purse of wild artist polanski than a penny-pinching castle ? this was to be his crowning achievement , though sadly the film is more often connected to polanski than castle . the remainder of his years are played out , and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece . across the board , everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man . somewhere along the way , he surely upset one or two people , but you would never know it from this film . and i find that find -- this is a celebration of bill castle's life , not ""e ! true hollywood story"" . fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work . i would personally recommend picking up the william castle collection , which has not only this but eight of castle's films in it , with plenty of special features . even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how schwarz was personally affected by castle , and have castle's daughter terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes . it's almost a whole new film .",1,8
"stan & ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer . the boys are wonderful in this feature , which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces , the horn factory . always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation , laurel & hardy inhabit a world where icy radios & bedded billy goats are the rule , not the exception . with its brief length , the film is more in style with their classic short subjects , which explains its episodic nature . only the boys get screen credit , but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces : james finlayson appears as a loony doctor , richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role , sweet mary gordon plays the boys' perplexed neighbor . that's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber . one of the film's script writers was silent comedian harry langdon . stan & ollie are the main focus , however . watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn , or laurel's antics with bananas , for instance , reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants .",1,10
"this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there . but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie . hanks is a great actor to be sure , but lacks the smarmy , morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role . jeff daniels would have been my choice . putting melanie griffiths in , for eye candy reasons , is understandable , but again , she did not portray the depth or ambivalence , so need to pull this off . this movie is a great example of how every decision , even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file .",0,3

"oh , boy , god bless the 1970's , we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade : the exorcist , jaws , the texas chainsaw massacre , halloween and now , raggedy ann & andy : a musical adventure . this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world , i mean seriously , this movie scared the heck out of me . my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money . what the heck ? it's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of toy story , pretty much down to a key , only this was a thousand times scarier , disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children . whenever marcella leaves the room , raggedy ann , along with her brother raggedy andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life . on marcella's birthday , a new doll , babette , arrives from paris , france to the united states of america . babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll , but the friendly raggedy ann does everything she can to make babette feel at home . however , the pirate captain contagious kidnaps her . raggedy ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before marcella discovers babette is gone . out in the world outside the nursery , the two meet the camel with the wrinkled knees , a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely . after raggedy ann and andy hitch a ride on the camel , he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking , runs over the edge of a cliff , into a deep pit . in this pit they encounter the greedy , who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full . the raggedys and the camel narrowly escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find babette and believe me , it just gets weirder from this point on . while this movie was certainly disturbing and i just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie , this was actually pretty creative . back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it , you can tell that they did that with raggedy ann & andy : a musical adventure . this certainly was not the worst movie i have ever seen , i just do not know who to recommend it too . as scared as i was , i have to admit i'm glad i watched it , sometimes you need a ""wtf ? ! "" movie to spice up your selection , believe me when i say that raggedy ann had no problem in doing just that with me . it's official , that doll is just plain creepy , let us just put it this way , there is a giant caramel river that is eating everything , a king who is head keeps getting bigger as he laughs , a bizarre thing that humiliates raggedy ann and her brother , a strange almost incest between ann and andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs . yikes . 7/10",1,7
"fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool . i have not seen the earlier film , and i do not know if that is a good thing or not . i can only regard the current film on its own merits . for most people , hal hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like or you do not . his combination of action , drama , absurdity and dry , ironic humour really resonates with me , and fay grim is no exception . it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud . for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness . it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes . during the second half of the film , the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller . whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear , but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum . the performances were generally good , particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum , who had the most screen time . saffron burrows , james urbaniak , carl montgomery and elina l wensohn all played good support roles . the film's visuals were nice ( set in new york , paris , berlin and istanbul ) and the music ( also by hartley ) was good without being intrusive . the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely . if you like hartley's earlier work , you will probably like this .",1,7

"'soapdish' is one of the best , yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's . the film revolves around the various off-camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera . the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it is fantastic a-list cast . 'soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it is era . the film is superbly led by sally field , as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert ( she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like ""gloria f*cking swanson ! "" ) . her supporting cast reads like a who is-who of 90's movie greats ! whoopi goldberg , robert downey jr , teri hatcher , kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly . goldberg is predictably excellent , whilst downey jr . 's and hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve . in terms of writing , the film is outstanding . there is a really modern edge to the script , which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions . there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time . in some ways , the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'high anxiety' ( 1977 ) . much of the film's humour hinges on it is often scathing , but pretty accurate , representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors . for example , the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher , is both hilarious and honest . 'soapdish' is , for my money , one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's . it's excellent script and a-class cast make it a must-see . it's hard not to love this film after it is kept you laughing for 90 minutes .",1,9
this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes . it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers . in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight . alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices ( with little acting ability ) and there is a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along . this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers . with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation .,0,3
"the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one . there are a few things that derail this film . first , tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals . in my opinion , any footwear on tarzan , whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed , takes away from the character , which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle . second , the character of benji , as mentioned in a previous post , totally derails the movie as the comic foil . to me , his character is unnecessary to the film's plot . also , while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan , it is apparent that he was not in his best shape . although in his later jungle jim movies , his physique had improved somewhat from this film . the octopus battle is a terrific idea , but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak . likewise , the battle , which takes only 30 seconds tops , would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate . and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye , it does not manage to salvage this last weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run .",0,4

"being a fan of movies like ""fire sale"" , ""where's poppa"" , ""airplane"" i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned . well , wrong conclusion ! not only is this not funny , it makes you angry because it is not bad in a schlocky , likable way but in a really bad way . it's bad-bad . the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you are trying to entertain your audience with humour . adam arkin's speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie . still this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera . this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story - if you can find one . ed mcmahon - i had to think of jay leno , another late night talk show person , who always refuses to call himself an actor . well , i've seen a few leno movies and he is laurence olivier compared to mcmahon . kenneth mars is good , though . in the few lines that he is given . i'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so . the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over - he literally does : starting 75 minutes into the movie he is in every scene . but it is too little , too late . when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you are supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that have not prepared for an exam . in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an 'f' .

"i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many , but this was simply not a very good attempt . its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original -- have not seen , and doubt i will . it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot , lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead ( jimmy fallon ) . fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that . he's supposed to be a teacher you see , and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach . the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable , but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot . not fallon , who is neither funny , nor an actor , but appears to think he is both . not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role , or believe that there is any way these two people should , or would be together . near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore ( who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance ) tells fallon that its over , too much has happened , and she is moving on . and rather than feeling bad about the scene , or sorry for fallon , you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago . but of course the plot mechanics will not allow that to be the end of it ( an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess ) , and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions . its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying , but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else .",0,3

"the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly , our main actress , orked was seen in a chinese language class . later in the film , she was asked on why ( by mukhsin ) that she was sent to learn mandarin . her answer was simple for a child she is; coz she is already known the malay language well . it's a bit of a romance one may thought of it , but once you have stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it , you will notice the typical elements of malaysia . the movie basically focuses on 10 year old orked who met 12 year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy's game . running out of players , mukhsin ( who was new in that village ) was forced to allow orked into the game , in which she eagerly showed the male side of her . orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie , defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school-bullies , throwing one of the bully's bag out from the school bus window , throwing punches and kicks on mukhsin's brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth . both were awesome buddies , and stick closer than that , but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way , parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town . now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin , they started out as friends , but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr . you would notice , the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love . the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor . the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you would be stuck on the screen for a long time . you will love the movie for what it is , and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes , coz it means much more . as the movie envelopes around the two love birds , it also manages to find its lens towards orked's parents , her mother who was educated in england , speaks very good english and in which , her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english , which was humor all the way indeed . let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie . and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness . often more than not , we do not learn to laugh at ourselves , and when we do , we do it at the expense of others . it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned - often when we are ourselves , we do not see the person in us we are , but when only when we are in another person's body , then only would we learn to see who we really are . and that is how humor applies as well , more so than just dignity . the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be . the other focus of this movie was on how orked's neighbor , a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife , and wanted to find another . pak koboi as what he is nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend . the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife . the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it , having interrupting on other people's business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use . after all , what goes around , comes around , and that is probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her . in every time , being nice to people around you will not hurt at all , unless you have an ego to protect , but then again , what is it worth ? the movie also centers around mukhsin's brother , hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night , smoking , drinking , and also finding 'girls' . he's the total opposite of mukhsin , but that is all perhaps because of family problems . both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them . i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself , but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all . she wanted us , me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves . movies in a way , take us out from our own body , places us in the character's position , and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it . depending on the type and genre of the movie , you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you .",1,9

"believe it or not , ""the woodchipper massacre"" gave me full-blown gonorrhea ! that's right , i've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution . it's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film . the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing ( not without several suicide attempts along the way ) was because , well first off , i was delirious with boredom , and second - i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing . . . this movie is a 'shot-on-video' ""horror/comedy"" about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt . the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo-replica hunting knife . they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools ( apparently she did not have a single drop of blood in her body ! ) and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper . . . her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too . . . i do not recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea . seriously , that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly . all of the actors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must have been written by a chimp that just did not care ! now , i can usually appreciate independent efforts , but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this ! i do not need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous , painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous , fluttery music playing over it . plus , why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it ? ! there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it ! i'm through with reminiscing about this movie . unless you like insufferable crap , i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash .",0,1
"this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films . the concept was really cool and different , the humor was unique , i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the ""punch"" into this movie . so many lines and gags were left hanging too long , with no definite ending and really did not leave me laughing . wilson , wilson , farris & thurman were great . wanda sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure , and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time . 7 out of 10 for me , more of a dvd rental . also , i was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits , something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films , a la something about mary , meet the parents but again , i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines . it felt like it was rushed into theaters .",1,7
"if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days do not bother . this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say . importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense , how children interpret the world ( and the violence in it ) , our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends . . all here , but not flatly on the surface . you could technically call it a ""monster movie"" even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end , and then it is even up to you and your beliefs as to what is happening with the legendary spirit/beast . some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores , though in fact the less you see of the creature , the better . fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out .",1,10

"jennifer's shadow is set in argentina & starts as jennifer cassi ( gina philips ) arrives there after her sister johanna dies . jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will , jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen ( faye dunaway ) is opposed to the sale . however strange things begin to happen , jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill . after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared , what is happening to jennifer ? is it an ancient family curse ? will jennifer be the next to succumb to it . . . this argentinian american co-production was co-written & co-directed by daniel de la vega & pablo par s & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes , a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them . the script by vega , par s & p . j . pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants , i mean i'm sure most people do not want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls . the character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do . for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy ? how did he know about the demons ? what is his interest & motivation for getting involved ? i could not see it . jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady , her grandmother mary allen is as clich d as they come & it is surprising that she is so obviously the villain . i mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it is surprisingly predictable & routine . there are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which is not much of a twist i did not like jennifer's shadow one iota . directors vega & par s goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white , i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it is been done so many times before & often so much better that it did not do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless . there's a definite 40's period look as well , from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it is rather half hearted & cheap looking . jennifer's shadow is well made but it is rather forgettable , it is not scary or creepy & it is rather predictable . if that was not enough there is no gore either , there is a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else . with a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 & retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it is us & international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million will not buy you too much these days & jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory . there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well , even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying . the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money . jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish , i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies ! ! ?

"riff randell is a wildly , obsessed fan of the rock group; the ramones and so are most of the students in the school . but a new tyrant of a principal , ms . togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students , especially the music from the ramones . so , when riff finds out they are performing in town , she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends . but when ms . togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets . while , this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff , but riff's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom . but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song . fun ! fun ! fun ! yep , that is right 'rock n roll high school' does not drift away from it main focus a boisterously , daggy romp ! it was not what i was expecting , that is for sure . everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they are having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit , which makes it a priceless experience . that's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be . but watching this passionately , crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks , i just could not wipe the grin off my face . it's tacky , very cheesy , densely chaotic , but damn it is funky-dory ! this low-budget , b-grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co-writer ( and plus he co-directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot ) . is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clich s and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults ( who always know best ) . these features might not be particularly fresh , but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically , gusto treatment . the film has just one thing on mind , to go out on a bang ! and they manage to do that . courtesy of 'the ramones' , who play themselves . really , you could say its one big trendy video clip , since it is all about the ramones well , most of it anyway . i see a lot flack towards the ramones' acting ability . these are musicians not actors , which means it is not about their acting here , it is the music we are suppose to dig . they're here to perform ! which , they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe . especially , their flamboyant concert performances . the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo , the velvet underground , mc5 , fleetwood mack , eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper . but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well . especially in the scenes involving ms . togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set . the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it is sometimes clever , tongue-in-cheek dialogue . thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags , which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself . what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles ( better known for her performance in halloween ) , who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell . other exemplary performances were dey young , as the extremely cute kate rambeau , vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who is stupendously played by clint howard . also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who is excellent as the demanding ms . togar who is pushing her unfair reign on the students , paul bartel as mr . mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end . the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy , but that goes down well with the material and there is a certain likability stemming from these characters , but we totally despise ms . togar and her hall monitor goons . there's no beating around the bush here when i say 'rock 'n' roll high school' is an intoxicating hoot , of a rad time !",1,8

"when it first came out , this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation . luckily , it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema , especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television , and the bad evolution of most direct cinema . really , at first , we must say that this is not really direct cinema , it is more cinema verit . the difference between the two is very slight , but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary , we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers , and they do interact with the characters filmed . this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation . the meysels have been allowed in the house , and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household . and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed . it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews . here , we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house , a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith . their house is a mess , litter and animals everywhere , faded colors and furniture all over the house , and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality . these two people have lived with each other their whole life , and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention , but rather because they cannot help talking to each other this way . they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings , there is no need . in the end , though , even as they blame each other for their lives , they really love each other deeply . edie says she does not want her mother to die , because she loves her very much , and edith says that she does not want edie to leave her because she does not want to be alone . but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age , the two women cannot help be girls . they cannot help being one the singer , the other the dancer . exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera . when edie asks david meysels rhetorically ""where have you been all my life ?

"****don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of ""the crater lake monster"" to be a total surprise**** a claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of crater lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks , not to mention your fast forward button . to call ""the crater lake monster"" amateurish is to overstate the obvious . if you are not a fan of low budget drive-in films , you probably would not be looking here in the first place . the problem with the movie is that when there is no monster action going on , it really sucks and goes nowhere . the script is very ed wood-ish , in that it is utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences . nothing is too outlandish for ""the crater lake monster"" . it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into crater lake , 'superheating' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia . even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable , would not ""superheating"" the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate ? other than some token fog in one or two scenes , we see no evidence of the water being hot , other than a few lines in the script . the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences , and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino . a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced , they decide to rent a boat and head out into crater lake . hmmmm . . . do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity ? in a sequence that is just plain bizarre , a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze . a car chase ensues , and would not ya know it . . . they end up right by the lake . snack time for cratey ! yeah , it is not hard to figure out , and you are so far ahead of the script that you are irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold . the shamelessness of it all is endearing , and i really want to like ""the crater lake monster"" . i just cannot do it . there's not enough here to go on , and this is more of a movie to put on during a party , because you could talk right over it and it would not matter . the film has a slim list of the things going for it , the most important being the dinosaur itself , which appears in three forms : a shadow puppet , a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water , and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good . there are also a pair of lovable hicks in it , and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie . a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks , so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it . why was i so affected by this conclusion ? was it the mournful song played over the closing credits ? or was i just weeping inwardly for the time that i waste watching films like this ?",0,3

( i liked the theme song-- but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film ! ) don black , who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music ? it figures that i should pull this out , less than a week after re-reading the comic-book adaptation . the first 15-20 minutes of the film more-or-less ( really , less ) parallel the first issue of the comic . as i watched it tonight , i kept wondering-- why was almost every single detail changed ? doc showing up , then using his wrist-watch remote-control to open the safe , and the sniper's bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass , were just about the only things left the same . i mean , if you are gonna do an ""adaptation"" , why in god's name change everything ? ? ? once they leave doc's hq , virtually nothing is as it was in the comic ( which , given roy thomas , i figure probably follows the book ) . i read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie . again-- why ? i've heard it was changed because they were not able to secure the kind of budget they wanted . i look at the film , and think . . . lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screen ! ! you know , when people complain about joel schumacher , they should really take a look at this thing . the best thing i can say is , i think it would make a great double-feature with the 1966 batman feature-- and probably a great triple-bill with that and the 1980 flash gordon . all 3 films are ""silly"" . maybe we can ""blame"" the 1966 film ( and tv series ) for this . some fans have complained over the years that adam west's batman ruined the image of comic-books in the minds of generations of non-comics fans . i think the same could be said for hollywood . i'm reminded of how many really , really bad films based on ""classic"" characters have been made over the years , especially ( it seems to me ) in the late 70's & early 80's . charlie chan , fu manchu , tarzan , buck rogers , flash gordon , the lone ranger-- all ""murdered"" by hollywood types who think , ""oh , comic-books ! so you know it is supposed to be stupid ! "" more like they are the ""stupid"" ones . what a waste of potential . let me say some good things . . . despite the script and the directing , ron ely is great . when i read a doc savage story , i do not think of the james bama paintings , i think of ely . bill lucking ( who later was a regular on the a-team ) is terrific . eldon quick ( who i've seen somewhere else , but cannot recall where ) is terrific . paul gleason-- who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club ( ""teachers"" like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere ) , may be the best of the ""amazing 5"" in the film . pamela hensley-- though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story-- is terrific . before she let her hair down , i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like ""ardala valmar"" from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips i just read the other day . she is got a big nose like ardala-- only not quite as pronounced . the comics ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura-- or cher . or maybe streisand . take yer pick . ( ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips-- after , she was stunning ! ) paul wexler , funny enough , i saw just last week in a get smart episode . i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing ? i do not know , because that character sure was not in the movie the film takes its title from .",0,4
"despite its low-key release in this country , and its apparent disregard in other countries ( the 'r' rating in the states cannot have helped - honestly , just because hbc uses the c-word ! ) , this is actually a fine piece of work . the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it , but it is overcome by the playing of the two leads . it's easy to win plaudits just because you are playing a physical or mental cripple ( daniel day-lewis , geoffrey rush , dustin hoffman , etc . ) , and helena bonham-carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd , but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely . in fact , almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes ( and what eyes ! ) . this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation , and emerging as a figure of some stature . awards must surely follow , though not , alas , for this fine performance . branagh , one feels , has never quite given his best on film ( except possibly 'hamlet' , and there his playing was diluted by the large cast ) . here , though , he tops his other appearances , playing to the hilt a self-loathing , unstable , ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he has not always displayed , and exhibiting both intelligence and depth . in short , we believe him , just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein , as the priest in 'the proposition' , as the lawyer in 'the gingerbread man' , even as andrew in 'peter's friends' . this is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier ? as a film , it looks more like a television offering , and without its stars it probably would not amount to very much . but it is been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this , and i eagerly await more from them ( though not 'love's labour's lost' . . . ) . 8 out of 10 , but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10 .",1,8
"the only reason i came across this movie was that it is on the little miss marker dvd and i do recommend watching it although you will not like it as well as the better known movie . we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion . the film starts out quite light , but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from his brother-in-law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother-in-law elects to keep her . however , he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops . cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she is in . there's little music in this , and shirley only has one song . however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss marker .",1,7
"this is crap . . . . utter crap . i cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this . full moon has a number of awful films , but this has got to be the worst . first off , the plot does not exist . it's odd . it's like , they took an idea for the story , and kind of never really got around to developing it . they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two ""heroes"" drove around in the desert , and bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes . there were two scenes in the movie ( when dez and dazzy are driving , and when dez and bradbury are driving ) where it just went on and on and on . . . it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action . they just drove for about 5 minutes , with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape . next , we come to the acting , which is simply horrible . first off , the girl who plays dazzy is just a beast . she is so scary looking , i wanted to look away when she was on screen ! horrible casting . then , you have the guy who played dez , who could not act if his life depended on it . his ""crying"" is actually funny , and his madman antics are even funnier . the guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad , as is the guy who plays bradbury . there was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever . the makeup effects . . . hmmm , can anyone say pathetic ? the ""effects"" were so fake , they were laughable . the crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone , they cut away , and when they come back , the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound . nice . did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what ? ! i must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment . . . nice makeup there too . i think they were going for a drugged look , and i think she was supposed to have a black guy , but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween . this movie is just horrible from the start . the story is stupid and very , very unoriginal , the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old , the acting is the lowest of the low , and so on . stay away from this movie at all costs . it's only 70 minutes long in the first place , and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel . do not waste your time on this piece of garbage .",0,1
"director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which , although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration , manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience . morgan sullivan ( jeremy northam ) , a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife , decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp . his job is to travel to conferences across the country ( under the assumed identity of jack thursby ) and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses , via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo . in reality , however , the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities . morgan , along with his fellow conference attendees , is being brainwashed . the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma , during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities . once they are totally convinced that they are someone else , they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies , where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion . but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster ( lucy liu ) , who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening . she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques . she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby , then he will be 'eliminated' . morgan plays along , and applies for a job at rival business sunways . however , arriving at his new workplace , he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy . fortunately , the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent . from hereon in , things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone . in an exciting finale , all eventually becomes clear ( but only if you have been following events very carefully ) . director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget . he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; jeremy northam , in particular , is fantastic his portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection . cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects , high rise and necropolis .",1,8
"one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray . boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd ( especially the camera technique karloff , as janos rukh , uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite ) and downright laughable , i did not care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable . the effects are done well for the time , the acting is great , and the finish is particularly strong . it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s , complete with ray guns and ridiculous science . you must watch this movie !",1,8
"after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about ( teenage ) witches yet has to be made . i did not think much of the craft and i'm not into charmed either . the only film i more or less enjoyed ( about teenage witches ) was little witches ( 1996 ) , and even that one was not very good . but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies , you will also enjoy midnight offerings . i was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school . but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious . the acting is decent and serious all the time . no jokes are being played by teenagers or something . and the musical score , at first , i thought was pretty good . it added some scariness and also something 'classy' , with the use of threatening violins and all . but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious . they did not have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed . then there is melissa sue anderson , who was the main reason for me to see this movie . a few weeks ago , i saw her in happy birthday to me , a rather enjoyable , thick-plotted ( and goofy on some occasions ) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings . and i must say , she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch vivian . but the main problem with the movie is : almost nothing happens ! vivian causes a death and an accident , yes , but that is it . then there is robin , the good witch , who is just learning about her powers . and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once , but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles . that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches ? and what is worse , i was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects , flaming eyes or whatever . . . but nothing happens . there is sort of a confrontation in the end , but it is a big disappointment . so , the acting of the two witches was good . the musical score was decent ( even though overly ambitious ) . and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times . but that does not make a good movie yet , does it ?",0,4

"well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i'll never get back on this piece of trash . i heard someone online describe this movie's villains as ""subhuman cannibals"" , and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent . wrong ! the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline . these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch . this movie is not so controversial , i've seen this level of gore in many films . this movie plain sucks . synopsis : a blonde who thinks she is real hot ( but she is not ) , her admirer , and her admirer's friend ( no , i do not remember their names ) go into the woods . their car breaks down . they are warned to leave by a man named mark . the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they cannot find the admirer's friend . admirer impales his foot ( whoops ! ) . don't worry , he is much more upset when his car will not start than when he gets impaled by nails . after a nanosecond of coaxing , the blond leaves to find help . events ensue that i cannot remember . during this and throughout the movie , we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag . blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals ( even though all they are seen eating is intestines , which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food ) . blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard ( unsuccessfully ) to work up tears . then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can ""out think them"" . mark ( the man who warned them to leave ) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family . then there is some shooting , they leave the house , the shooting continues , then a random guy shows up and says he is been watching them . before he is shot , we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing . the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them . there's more killing , the admirer professes his love for the blonde . then a mysterious hand covers the camera . what does that imply ? i do not know , hopefully not a sequel .",0,1

"this is an amazing film to watch or show young people . aside from a very brief nude scene , it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you will rarely find in other films . it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa , but without all the romantic fluff . the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they do not even seem to regard the natives as people . the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question . however , unlike real servants , you only once hear any of the whites say 'thank you' and no other regard is given these people . again and again , it is like they are pets or slaves , as the feelings of the people are never even considered . the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother , aim e and her servant , prot e . although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other , the white woman never considers prot e or the existence of his feelings . a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has prot e lace up her dress and it is obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this . apart from this relationship , while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people , a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage . also interesting is the relationship between prot e and the little girl ( who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film ) . while they are very close , at times he is more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children . there is one bizarre white character who seems , at times , to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing . one moment , he is doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them ( something the other whites would never have done ) and the next he is trying to beat up prot e ! i could only guess as to what motivated him--perhaps he was just a jerk , or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites ( who knows ! ) . in fact , other than a few good scenes , this character seems pretty much wasted . while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave , i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life . the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more . the film appeared to begin in the early 1980s ( since she is wearing a walkman-style headset ) and when the film went back in time , it seems that it was set about 1960 ( more or less ) , but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti-colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s . i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier ( such as the 1970s ) and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s--before the country experienced political change . apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods , using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea . and i also appreciated the ending , as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride . but overall , it just feels like something is missing--there just is not any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel .",1,7

"secret sunshine ( 2007 ) is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in 2007 and other film festivals . jeon-do yeon , who played the newly widowed shin-ae , won the best actress trophy at the 60th cannes festival . secret sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and jeon-do yeon received a best actress nod from asia pacific screen awards . in addition , this movie won the best film awards in virtually all korean film festivals . masterfully written and directed , and uniquely photographed , secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy . this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people . lee chang dong , director and writer of this movie , said in an interview , ""in a vast sense , i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense . without love , we cannot talk about hope and salvation . "" lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre . this movie is not a movie about religion , but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the movie . the turning point in secret sunshine comes when jun , shin-ae's son , is kidnapped and killed . the kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land , she must be rich . her lie causes much sorrow . shin-ae becomes a church-goer and wants to forgive the murderer . she decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him . jong-chan , shin-ae's guy friend , says , ""just forgive in your heart . do you have to go to the prison ? "" her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her . her pastor agrees with what she wants to do . that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action . the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shin-ae's life . the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god . this sparks anger in her toward god . she says , ""how could you forgive the man before i forgive ? "" she begins to fight against god . she looks up to the sky and proclaims , ""i will not lose to you . "" she becomes a snare , her heart is a trap , and her hands are chains . it is more bitter than death . she becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital . on the day shin-ae is discharged from the hospital , she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face . the daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair . the murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped shin-ae's son . while she cuts shin-ae's hair , the protagonist cannot understand what is going on and gets out of the shop quickly . it is difficult not to talk about jong-chan in the movie . jong-chan does his best to be by shin-ae's side . although shin-ae does not care about him at all , he is beside her all the time . shin-ae leaves church quickly , but jong-chan , who started attending church because of shin-ae , stays there because he feels peace with god . lee chang-dong , the director of secret sunshine , says that jong-chan is like milyang ( secret sunshine ) , the rural city or vice versa . he seems to ""be too secular and frivolous , but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her . milyang is like him . "" mr . lee adds , ""someone joked that jong-chan could be an angel . i think that he could be the angel . who knows ? we cannot say for sure that there is no angel . "" if there is a person like jong-chan who forever accompanies his lover's twists and turns , we can defend ourselves against the overpowered . the life of shin-ae is full of meaninglessness . her husband died after he cheated on her , and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown . and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong way and that makes her crazy , literally . it is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness . does she still have hope in her life ? can she find meaning in her life ? the final scene gives us hope . shin-ae tries to cut her hair by herself : we walk our life's journey by ourselves . she , however , realizes that it is hard to do it by herself , and we know that we cannot do everything by ourselves . we see jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair . that's her hope . she has jong-chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is . as i mentioned earlier , jong-chan is like an angel for her . if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us , we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives . secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea . it is like da vinci code . while da vinci code helps us discuss the early church history , secret sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable . with a shallow interpretation of the movie , people misunderstand christianity and its theology . with a deeper interpretation , this movie will help us see beneath the surface . some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine , and lee chang-dong responds by saying , ""they were already anti-christ before they watched this movie . secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shin-ae's life .",1,9

"ron howard directed this ? the 1966 cartoon is charming , teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot . in this movie , howard gives us a whoville filled with greedy , manipulative , self-centered whos . jim carrey is terrible , but i'm sure it is not his fault; i imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable , so carrey channeled tom green and the result is movie magic . much like danny devito's penguin in batman returns , carrey's grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates . where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with , carrey's grinch is that angry , soulless old man that we have all seen at one time or another , sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane . this grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity , humor , or insight whatsoever , and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false . the whole movie rings false : there is some stupid christmas lighting competition , a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood , and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the whos have that weird lip extension and some of them do not . contrary to the 1966 cartoon , i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome , irritating , and filled with contradictory messages . did we really need to see slutty smurf , aka christine baranski as martha may whovier ? in addition , ron howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives . throw in the requisite butt jokes , fart jokes , sex jokes , and other obligatory carreyesque low-brow humor , and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon ( or book that inspired it ) as george w . bush is from rational , lucid thought . thumbs down on this big fat turkey .",0,1
"yes , i am just going to tell you about this one so do not read if you want surprises . i got this one with the title christmas evil . there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night , bloody night . whereas silent night , bloody night ( not to be confused with silent night , deadly night ) had lots of potential and was very close to being good , this one was not quite as good . it started out interesting enough watching the villain ( if you can call him that ) watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice , but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie does not deliver . you need character development , but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps . about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror , and the guys he kills are not even his targets they are just making fun of him . this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty . he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy , and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace . he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out . he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom . he cannot seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat . what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place ? oh yeah , the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too . well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play . what was that even about ? he kept talking about something that was never really explained . how does it end you ask , well since i have spoilers i will tell you . he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to , well lets just say it was lame ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",0,2
"the performance by om puri , smita patil , and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely , along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani . the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great . i have not seen another movie like this . it is one whole , each piece so nicely fit in the plot . you cannot not be impressed by this movie . amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of om puri . om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty's at sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning . smita patil does not play a main role , but her part is also not distracting from the main plot . and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . he is also the 'guru' of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble . the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya . a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .",1,10
"***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings ( ""magnum force"" and ""the enforcer"" ) , dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in ""sudden impact , "" a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths : the charisma of clint eastwood , who also directed , and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes . for once , the case takes harry outside his native san francisco ( where he is again in trouble with his superiors for his ""shoot first , ask questions later"" tactics ) , to the hamlet of san paulo . there , ( warning : potential spoiler ) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered , one at a time , by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier , and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack . the killer is portrayed by sondra locke , and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness . locke's cold eyes and frosty voice , when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists , are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit . the rapists are a despicable lot , especially the leader , who has ""psycho nutjob"" practically stamped on his forehead , and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys , despite her anatomical inability to participate . the flashback scenes , while not graphically explicit , are nightmarish enough , and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants . some will dismiss ""sudden impact"" as trash : a mindless , manipulative revenge tale . on a certain level this is true , but it is well-done trash . what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance , giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech . what we have here is an action movie with a point of view . you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary , but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry ( a realization that , wisely , is not spelled out with dialogue ) , he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate . this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare . the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction . this is , after all , a dirty harry movie , and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else . the movie is directed with style and wit , and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff . some of the best ""harry moments"" in the entire series are here , including harry's best-known line , ""go ahead -- make my day . "" ""sudden impact"" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow . it is also a riveting detective story , well made and well told . and it is certainly never dull . on those criteria , it succeeds tremendously .",1,8

"lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker , whereas the likes of david lean , ridley scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope anderson`s movie are more about social commentary and subtext , so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers . i`m very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium ( the best brit movie makes are those who try to emulate hollywood in my opinion ) , if you want to send a message try pony express , and i find the movie dated , pretentious and too set in the 1960s . 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france . you can just imagine every single french leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax . french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it , and many will dislike it intensely",0,4
"i am anthony park , glenn park is my father . first off i want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the amber alert system is a good one . however the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible . the major problem i had with the movie involved the second half with nichole timmons and father glenn park . the events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct . my father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up nichole without any intent to harm her at all . he loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about . the movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form . the funny thing is that nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing . the reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck . my father was a landscaper . the items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work . my recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt , it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie ( at least the nichole timmons - glenn park portion ) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story . the funny thing is , that if the director would have interviewed any of sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what i have posted here .",0,1

"during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b . demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included . it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans , louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for it is pirate connections . when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper . paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !",1,10
"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film , because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well , and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role , yuwen , as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time . tian zhuangzhuang's film the 'blue kite' was a far better film . but do not be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s . unlike the blue kite , the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself , the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop . i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who cannot tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial . if any film fits the description of 'overrated , ' this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .",0,3
"****spoiler alert**** all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney . it's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton , richard chamberlain , got involved in a case , as a defense attorney , involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar . having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans , athol compton , death it is determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders . yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder . david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what is coming to them from the court . one of the defendants chris , david gulpili , begin to somehow invades david's dreams as if he want's to tell him what was really behind billy's death . david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse . chris confirms david's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams . later meeting chris and , what turns out to be an aborigine shaman , charlie ( nandjiwarna amagula ) who came to his house that evening david is told that he , like charlie , has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather . those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent . the earth , chris tells david , is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it is place . david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen . david want's to know if it is all aborigine folklore or there is some scientific facts , or logic , behind their end of world-like revelations . by now it is obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney . that alone can get chris off , as well as his four friends , for the murder of billy . since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines , leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves . still chris refuses to admit he is a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days . david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris' silence , and why billy had to die , is taken by chris to the scene of the crime . it's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris's aborigine tribe . it's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step-father rev . burton , david parslow , told him . the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david's been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions . it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent .",1,8
"sarah silverman is really the ""flavor of the month"" comic right now . is she really worth all the hype ? yes and no . she is funny at times , sometimes hilariously so ( her standup routine is actually quite interesting , though not always funny ) . other times , you are feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer . she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to , saying that they dig her intelligence and wit . but if you corner them , most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her , and that is why they watch her . she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo , even though neither of them are really ""hot"" now in terms of popularity . sarah does not drink or smoke ( at least cigs ) , so she should be hot when she is 60 , so her fans ( especially the male ones ) can rejoice . as for this show , it is very much like her comedy . when it works , it is hilarious . when it does not , it is full blown tedium and very , very boring . the aids episode here is the best one . it's consistently funny , and has some really good satire in it . brian poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode , and it is hilarious seeing him in a tab t-shirt . but they never really go anywhere with it , and it eventually wears out its welcome . sarah's character in the series is rather annoying , the gay couple ( brian poeshn and some other guy ) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole , and the supporting players ( including sarah's real life sister , laura , who does not look a thing like her ) are ok . when the jokes hit , they are brilliant . when they do not , they are awful , and i mean really awful . there's also an obsession with coprophilia here ( aka poop jokes ) , which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today . so should you watch this show ? if you have a crush on sarah , go for it . you can gaze at her and pretend she is yours . as for her show , it is ranges from good to absolute zero .",0,3
"a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism . setting the story around the famous book of kels , believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona , off the western coast of scotland . telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom-cruic , the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology . in hopes of recovering a lost artefact . the films true beauty lies in its' animation . cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity . deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series 'samurai jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth , the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion . the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic-revivalist mysticism . the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is , as she glides from branch to branch . appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland . the secret of kels is an absolute treat . for all genders , all ages , it is a lovely piece of family cinema . don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed !",1,7

"i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater . i'd been waiting for this since before they started filming . i was not disappointed . minor spoilers below- overall it was good , but it also lacked the continuity of the first two . identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama . this movie felt choppy at times . the plot-building down-times were slightly too drawn out . that caused the following action to feel too frenetic . camera : speaking of frenetic , the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me . i know its has been talked/whined about to nausea on the message board , but it does not mean it is not relevant . all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted . the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie . it is a cheap , student director trick to make the film feel unsettled . i'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids , but not in this classy , adult , action series . too much extreme close-up also . do some framing . get some interesting shots . constant close-up feels like lazy directing to me . story : the story was very confusing at first . they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go . gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you have missed some crucial information . felt rushed or compressed for time reasons . after you catch up however the story is quite good . it's enjoyable following leads along with bourne . however , i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy ( landy/bourne on the phone ) being in the middle of ultimatum thing . it basically makes the movie a half-prequel . i thought that was awkward . cast/characters : the star of the movie is the action . obviously there are only two originals left . bourne and nicky parsons . them teaming up was kind of odd to me . i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in . unless i completely missed something , they never even tell you why they teamed up . the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet . this felt like gilroy/greengrass/whoever wanting to not leave open ends . understandable but disappointing . seriously , damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy . . those scenes were phenomenal . these assassins are as uninteresting as castel ( the first fella bourne fights in identity ) . the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on . clive owen was practically an afterthought . that's a measure of strength for that first cast . the second , they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen . . . . not exactly equal . this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later . nothing against david strathairn , scott glenn , or albert finney , but they are not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series . aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long , the acting was right on . as a whole , it was successful . felt like they wanted to get the series over with though . if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts , eliminated scott glenn's part entirely , zoomed out , and taken the camera away from the seizure victim , it would have been perfect . ending spoiler i do not see why they leave bourne alive at the end . it was my understanding this was the conclusion . they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless . i thought that was going to be it . a full circle type of ending . i did like nicky reacting to the news report though . spoiler specifics warning - quote from movie below - bourne's last line at the end ""look at this . . look at what they make you give . "" quoting the first assassin he killed , i loved that . the final scene was great . ( except that it was vosen {strathairn} that shot at bourne . why would he do that ? just out for vengeance ? if he was angry enough to murder , why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file ? that did not make sense . )",1,7
"personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem . way back in the eighties , the early eighties , i discovered this movie , like so many released at the time , ""night patrol"" ""bad manners"" or even ""king frat"" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you . of course being of an age , movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like ""screwballs"" and the many others , captured the imagination , and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches . made many years after the huge success of ""animal house"" and having seen how it had fared down through the years , i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory , much like that of national lampoon's vacation . to be honest , not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success , however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies , with instantly recognisable characters , such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham , so good in charles band's ""terrorvision"" still lingering in the past glories of his youth . or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs . sweet as . which makes me ponder . as i already said , personal taste not withstanding . people can be so cruel , so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world . it does have some merit . being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes , who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work ""weird science"" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u . s bonds . what more can i say , it is a movie just waiting to be rediscovered , time and time again .",1,10

"it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men . after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage . and any woman who got involved with adam , hoss , and little joe were going to end up dying because we could not get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western . perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights . people have relationships , some go good , some not so good , it is just life . and we are less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we do not have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact . but that is if bonanza were done today . but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped , the secret of bonanza's success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons . ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name . his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children . the kids were all different in personality , but all came together in a pinch . the cartwrights became and still are an american institution . i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys . just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that . pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show . rumor has it he did not care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious . perhaps if it were done now , he would have liked it better in the way i describe . this was just the beginning for michael landon , how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit . landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control . little joe was the youngest , most hot headed , but the most romantic of the cartwrights . when roberts left . the show kept going with the two younger sons , but when big dan blocker left , the heart went out of bonanza . other characters had been added on by that time , david canary , tim matheson , and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel . but big , loyal , but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights . his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family . so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history . i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city . it does not look anything like what you see in bonanza . but near lake tahoe , just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits , is the cartwright home , the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction . like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans , the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are real . and if they were not real , they should have been .",1,9

"david lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way . they are interesting to look at and think about but they really do not gel in your mind . perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator . the straight story is not a typical david lynch film . not that there is anything typical about them anyway . it's an odyssey through rural america . a real life journey alvin straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house . he rode 300 miles from laurens , iowa to mt . zion , wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses . at the heart of this film is sweet voiced richard farnsworth . he brings alvin straight right to us in a simple and honest way . the fact that the film is slow paced matches alvin's slow journey toward realization . along the way alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl . she is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation . after listening to alvin speak about family she reconsiders . later alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car . she complains that she has killed several and leaves . alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night . later alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him . a nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed . they even let him call his sweet but slow daughter , nicely played by sissy spacek , whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past . alvin insists on paying for the call . the man even offers to drive alvin to his brothers with pleasure . alvin declines with thanks . while alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls . alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him . alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who have repaired his lawn mower . he talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs . he even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother . the night before alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him . the man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks alvin to write to him . this scene is perfect in it is simplicity . it's heartfelt because it is so straight , so real . the journey continues and we cannot help to get more and more involved with it . we want alvin to get to his brothers . we want him to make amends . we want to know this world is full of forgiveness . this was richard farnsworth at his best . it was his last film and his performance was amazing . you cannot help but to understand his pride , to listen to his wisdom , and to ultimately feel his pain . one becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in . if there is justice in the afterlife then alvin straight , his brother , and richard farnsworth are together sitting at a bar . i can picture them discussing their lives , regrets , hopes , and joys . as alvin says in the film , ""my brother and i used to look up at the stars .

"i should say at the outset there are many , many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes , i certainly consider it a 'classic' science-fiction film for many reasons . but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion . no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' "" . . . is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre . "" ambitious ? without a doubt . intelligent ? depends on what part of the film you are talking about . it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point . at a cost of nearly $2 million ( this was 1956 , remember ) , mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling , eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before , even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects . 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies , yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here . even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people , unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 . when i see the various sets and take note of the art design , models , costumes , etc . , i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz , ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects . so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless . 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at . the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated , matte paintings of planets and space in the background , and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth . it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you would ever see . the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex , where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible . but then we get to the actors , darn it . the performances are almost uniformly awful , though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor , except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble . even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance , it is lugubrious at times . a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j . j . adams , and does not convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film . he seems to instinctively know , thirty years ahead of time , that his true forte' lay in comedy , as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines . every forced reaction , whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation , looks right out of a high school play . anne francis , also very young , fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta , whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up . ( alta morbius , now there is a name for you . ) unfortunately , even at this early age , anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8 . ' there is a good story here , buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie , ' ship's cook . ( holliman turns in a horrendous performance too . i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school . ) based on shakespeare's 'the tempest , ' the story of a dead race , the krell , and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet , ' and for good reason . for a few minutes here and there , you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex . is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings ? you'll have to decide that on your own . oh , and of course there is robby the robot , every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like . he's funny . in places . so , 'forbidden planet' to me is a very , very mixed bag . it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed , not least of which was 'star trek . ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it is more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again .",1,7
"this was a truly insipid film . the performances are third rate , and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died . my reason for renting this was simple : find a movie with scriptwriting . i needed a visual aid for my presentation , so i figured why not use a clip ? boy was i wrong . after searching my local video store , i came upon this , where it was suspiciously titled ""starstruck"" . i thought , ""what the hey"" , and decided to give it a try . well , i was very unhappy with my results . there was maybe one scene i could use , and meanwhile , i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick . so . . . . . i took this back and picked up ed wood . there's a movie i can use as an example . then again , anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is ""starfucker"" .",0,1
"this is just horrible , really horrible trash . yes , we have got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex . but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie may have even been a hit as a porn movie this tries to mask itself as a ""film"" with actual things to say , with real emotion and struggle . it is not . it's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time . i'm sure all of these women ( and men ) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business . the acting was hackneyed , so bad , i mean real terrible . the writing was even worse . i cannot lay all blame on these actors they had nothing to work with . the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors . the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar , as a sniper . these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough . if there was more writing - better writing , much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with . this movie should have been shot , made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along; it would have made more money . it practically is a hardcore porn film already , and it remains the only non-porn movie i've seen that shows a male erect penis .",0,1
"relative to other columbo movies , this can only be rated a 1 ( awful ) . i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film . it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next . another reviewer suggested that it was falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role . in fact , i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses , who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money . it's a wonder they did not murder him .",0,1

"i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon . com based on my other interests . they hit the nail on the head with this one . i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it . ten years later , it is like watching it all again for the first time . lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together , even though they are somewhat rivals . almost representing good ( caleb ) and evil ( sherriff lucas buck ) . i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be , but let it suffice to say , he has some special powers that i do not believe were granted by anything holy . he can make phones ring , writing appear , or even cause a person's emotions to change . none the less , there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all . all in all , this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of , ( i . e . point pleasant , threshold , nowhere man , and seaquest dsv just to name a few ) were cancelled way before their time . the steven king's the dead zone ( sunday's usa network ) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it . there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore . this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv . so , in the meantime , i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch ""quality"" shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons ( what a bunch of crap that is ) .",1,10

"harvey keital's best performance so far the new century . very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba . the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections . it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does not yet understand . the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema . the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us . unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . but if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world . recommended .",1,9
"this film is like marmite . you either love it or you hate it . if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values , a good plot and great characters you will hate it . if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you will probably hate it . if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it . john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane , murderous coke fiend . the special effects are abysmal at best but really , who cares ? if you are the kind of person who is prepared to watch a film schizophreniac : the whore mangler you have undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore . with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would have mediocre at best . i'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre . to sum it up , you will probably hate this film but if you are one of the few who decide to see it anyway it will become the best thing since sliced bread #2 i hate marmite .",1,8

"the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's , at one of our art houses as a revival . as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality , i thought yowza ! they got away with murder in europe back in the day . unfortunately , this film was heavily cut in it is original u . s . release by the blue nosed hayes office ( the staunch government censorship board , started by the ""holier than thou"" bible thumper , will hayes . . . a former post office official , if you can believe that ) , due to it is overall theme of human sexuality ( heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's ) . the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman ( played by hedy lamarr ) who marries a much older man , and later regrets it . she ( lamarr ) meets a handsome younger man & has an affair with him , resulting in a divorce from previous husband ( another no no in hollywood movies back then---divorce ! ) . despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933 , it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format ( i . e . the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films---i . e . 1920's expressionism's ) . it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures , along with luis bunuels l'age dor ( 1930 ) , and karl gustav dryer's 'vampyre' ( 1931 ) . not rated , but contains that infamous nude swimming scene & some thinly veiled sexual references , which would fare little more than a pg-13 by today's standards ( but would have easily landed the dreaded 'x' , back in the 30's , if it existed then )",1,10
"the rumor is true : girls like coyote ugly more than guys . and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given . jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer . and after initial frustration of having no luck , overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night . she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise ! the place is completely full of ""two year old toddlers"" bursting at the sight of babes dancing . the story is not bad and some characters are likeable , especially cammie ( the ""fashion coordinator"" part was cute ) and the bouncer but let us face it , the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning . violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie . and check out violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer ! for the first time i could think of , how could the production be so terrible ? for a brief moment with this movie , hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying , ""you were warned ! "" instead , it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world . advertising babes in a bar , but showing a paper thin ""pursue your dream"" story disappointed every male teen you targeted ! and finally , the music . there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie , especially when it was needed ( the hospital scene ) . every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened . but the climax was an ultimate laugher : an '80s like song you would expect cyndi lauper to jump on the stage and jam with violet . heck , i personally thought bon jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too ! other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing ( especially the wet scene ) , and a couple cute cliches , coyote ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about . whether you watched or made it , it looked like nothing but time killing . or wasting depending on how you look at it .",0,3
"seriously what were they thinking ? over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it . this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie . main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed . the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation . also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized' . director alan j . levi did some other columbo movies in the past , which all very much sticked to the usual formula . it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie . the columbo character himself also feels quite different , perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation , when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding . the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also does not exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch . in all honesty , the movie does not begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses . it's such a stupid written kidnap-thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely . it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable . this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really does not know to entertain its viewers in any way . it also does not help much that the supporting actors are not the most talented ones around . despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style , peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie . can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him ? it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you . an odd columbo entry , which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula . 4/10",0,4
"i hate to sound like an 'old person' , but frankly i have not seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 . . . generally , movies just seem to get worse and worse ( although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle ""the bread , my sweet"" , except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie ) . this movie makes the mother , a former las vegas chorus girl , seem to be incapable of surviving on her own , although she is clearly in her 50s ( though hinted at being in her 40s ) . i did not buy it . i'm 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s , more than capable of surviving on my own ( as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13 , got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey . ) the daughter is not believable in her job role . . . she gets a promotion she does not deserve ( a great opportunity ) and drops that ball too , but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver , the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist' , when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker , a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises ( to her boss , in this case ) . the daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her , on a temporary basis , but then treats her mother ( the woman who gave her life and raised her to 'adulthood' ) like a pariah . apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is not 'the common thing' for parents to act like children , and then be treated as children by their children . that is just more of the societal 'baloney' that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we , their public , were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings . this is a sad movie with a stupid ending . if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character' , he would have stayed with the mother , who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . but in the end he 'falls' for the daughter , a shallow , rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth , but in an ordinary , bland way . ( the 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive , physically . ) there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter ( who was an uptight , selfish , self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect ) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted , sweet-tempered , humorous , and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . of course the mother had her own flaws . . . she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter . regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed , this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney .

"this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman , as we have an innocent ( black ) man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man . usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster . that does not apply here . of course i love everything david morse does , so maybe my comments are not fair , but there were more good things about this film then that . the main baddy , played by doug hutchison , was brilliant , and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli . our hero , alvin sanders ( played by jamie foxx ) , was however irritating most of the part . he is so out of place , cracking bad jokes , evoking no sympathy from the audience . or not to begin with , the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you ( and on his followers as well ! ) . i did not expect much when i rented it , but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits . 7/10",1,7

"okay . . . it seems like so far , only the barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint . beware , this writeup is *long* . for those not in the knowing ( mostly the non-belgians ) : tom barman , director of this film , is the frontman of deus , one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in belgium . basically , they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale . then , egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart , with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deus-monicker . the way it always happens in such cases , the post-breakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original . they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album ""the ideal crash"" in 1999 , presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting . they did not quite make it . however , egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies . more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake , and this film does not make the exception . and barman clearly went for *art* on this one , another very big mistake . for one thing , he is a musician , not a movie director . for another , deus at it is best made fun and provoking music , but never anything close to what i would consider *art* . it shows . so , what is this movie about ? basically , it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people , doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp , as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting . the characters are shallow , the plot totally pointless and the film just does not have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings . humor ? the whole film made me smile ( slightly ) about 3 times , and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh ( not quite loud ) . mood ? the film just does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all . mystery ? well , ( *minor spoiler* ) the idea of the ""wind-man"" , inspiring the name of the film , is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very , and has been done a thousand times before ( anyone remember johny destiny - one of tarantino's worst appearances on film to date ) ( *end minor spoiler* ) . and well , its *artistic* , so do not expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous . in other words , except for the few smiles , it bored me out of my shorts . so what remains ? well , the soundtrack is pretty good , though it suffers from some of the same problems that other ost's have shown lately : first , it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd . second , it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs , which simply does not work . in the end , it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs . and sadly , it is barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention , though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i'm concerned . all in all , it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies . camera work is okay as well , though not anything that would make you scream out with joy . the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor . since i originate from antwerp , it was fun to play a kind of ""guess-the-location"" game . i would hardly consider this as a quality though . all in all , another chance lost for flemmish film . i keep on noticing that lately , the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country . this is mostly because at least , they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional ( the brothers daerden come to mind ) . maybe the flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too .",0,4
"this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon . the ""sisters"" in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council . it is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges . it will leave you , as it left me , with many questions about exactly how this change occurred . how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon ? have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses ? was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court , against the express wishes of the husband , a one time event ? i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions . they made the movie two years ago , not yesterday . and the movie they made deserves a wide audience .",1,9

"le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film , a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director isma l ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazal and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film . ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian ( a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters ) and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys . reda ( nicolas cazal ) lives with his muslim family in southern france , a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage . his elderly father ( mohamed majd ) has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca , and being unable to drive , requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation . the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france , into italy , and on through bulgaria , croatia , slovenia , and turkey to saudi arabia . along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights , but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands . on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ( ghina ognianova ) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda , a turkish man mustapha ( jacky nercessian ) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing , and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons . tensions between father and son mount : reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps , and the father cannot comprehend reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs . at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to reda . the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning . it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age , between son and father , and between defiance and acceptance of religious values . the visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects . nicolas cazal is a superb actor ( be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer's son' ) and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film . another fine film from the film movement , this is a tender story brilliantly told . highly recommended . grady harp",1,10
"ok i will sum up this movie . . . a bunch of skanky british women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies . the whole movie consists of these women talking , smoking , and rarely going out for ""meat"" or humans to eat . i swear i had to make myself watch this movie . . . ugh",0,1
"man on fire was hot . i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge , and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl . the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy ( denzel washington ) and pita ( dakota fanning ) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita . it was also good that creasy was not a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the ""proper"" channels , but instead used torture tactics and street smarts . some may say , ""torture is wrong regardless , "" and you may be right , but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back , you cannot help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless . there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that . creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys . but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie , it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back . his death was noble in fact . denzel does an excellent job as do the writers . this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie .",1,8
"108 : tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) - released 4/20/1934 , viewed 8/6/08 . john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa . bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas . births : ralph nader , gloria steinem , alan arkin , richard chamberlain . doug : after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man , ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film , 'tarzan and his mate , ' was the best in the series . it's true . i got a huge kick out of this movie . johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging , animal dueling wild super-hero , and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane ( who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here ) . in my review for 'ape man , ' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming , but she is redeemed herself for me here . make no mistake : o'sullivan is the star of this movie , and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast . she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan , she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals , and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she is out of bullets . she is even got her own jungle scream now . the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible . she is totally got him trained . cheeta is quite charming as well , taking drags off of martin's cigarette . the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals , especially lions , crocodiles , and rhinos . the effects , though always visible , are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely . oh , and you cannot talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene . all i can say is : yes , she is naked . very exciting stuff . kevin : wow . just wow . when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure , nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate . ' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass , violent and risqu jungle epic . i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does . you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved , or animal rights-approved for that matter . the gruesome violence does not even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies . and after t&j enter the picture , there is plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims . see it for yourself if you do not believe me . i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film . in the first film , jane seemed like a walking contradiction , like the writers back then just did not know how to portray a character like that . but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema . although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams , she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued . her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living ( relatively ) comfortably in the jungle for a year . i watched this with my mom , and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan ""trained , "" as jeff foxworthy put it . she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call . although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film , there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs . predator battles that are performed ( mostly ) for real . that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around . **spoiler** the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing . although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious , i cannot help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again . **end spoiler** one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth , hairless bod and over-styled coif . other than that , this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed . last film : it happened one night ( 1934 ) . next film : twentieth century ( 1934 ) .",1,10
"after hearing raves about this movie for years , i finally decided to rent it and watch . let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library . this move was slow , boring , unrealistic and the plot made no sense . after 2 hours , i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery . i realize that taste is subjective , but believe me , i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie . dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie . rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good .",0,3

"fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film . it has all the pieces of acting , direction , storyline , and entertainment value . they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece , fay grim . this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing . soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry's . these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings . fay is sent to find these journals , in return to release her brother from prison , and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about . parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show . she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers , but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies . posey made me believe what was happening on screen , i felt for her , i rooted for her , and i wanted to know more . she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you cannot stop thinking about what is happening to her . i have not seen any other previous works by writer/director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was . if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim . if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely .",1,10
"i really cannot understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star . . . how can you like such a retarded film , where all the animal abuse scenes are real ? i do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments . . . jesus . . . what kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason , or just for money ? i tell you , that director is either mentally retarded , or he is just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone . or both . he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive . it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock , especially to sensitive persons and children : a real frog is skinned alive , fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water , a dog is beaten , birds are thrown into the water . . . this movie is more than awful; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made , along with another one , called ''cannibal holocaust'' or something like that . i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster . no one should waste their time watching it , especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there , in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged . fortunately , only a few people liked this - which is natural , since it is the worst film ever - , so it was not successful . i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised , and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films . i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give ! there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others . this , however , is probably my only ''negative'' review . i usually do not comment on a movie if i dislike it , but this time i just could not shut up . i had to speak the truth , because animal abuse must stop !",0,1

"black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us ""vampyres"" and much later , ""rest in pieces"" , among others . . i'm only noting the ones i've seen . at any rate , we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it , and the man keels over . not sure if it was good for either of them , at that point . fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will , or something to that effect , and of course everybody else except her is in on something , which happens to be devil worship . it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times . to spice things up though , there is a simulated bestiality scene ( i hope it is simulated ) with a black goat , sure to be a crowd pleaser . ugh . at times this echoes ""rosemary's baby"" , minus the baby , because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too , because that keeps getting remarked upon . however , the herbs are not the only thing that reeks about this film . the end seems to be back to the beginning again , and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they have been during the middle part . it's not unwatchable , it is just not very good , and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films , and there was not much here that did anything much for me . 3 out of 10 .",0,3
"i saw this at a screening last night too . i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected . not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion . i will not bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better . but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real . he was funny , and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies . don cheadle was believable as always . this movie is not funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it . i'd say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film . midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together . i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves .",1,9
"the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father . the brilliant dialog , lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers . the core issues of parenting , communication and manhood are explored indirectly . in fun ways the curtain is pulled back , the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed . all of this happens amidst a road trip format . the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors . wow !",1,9
"i am currently doing film studies at a . s level and ""this is not a love song"" is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back-story . if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers , after committing a murder : -""sounds quite exiting"" . however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre . as it is suggested , it is a love story between two homosexual lovers , filled with trust , deceit and betrayal . we are not told about this ""love"" directly through the film but the events that happen through out , for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces . overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as ""rubbish"" just because they are done on a low budget . a good film with an intricate story line , however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters .",1,7
"the number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 . they do not follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve . this one dropped a second body . that body , and dean , drop about 20 feet from sam but then they are right with sam . flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum , at night , and we can still see everything . it's night but light is streaming through the windows . a ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls ? come on ! there is no way sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to sam like it was not his first visit . sam and dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and did not do anything to help them . that does not seem like a thing the winchester boys would do . oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt . while the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times i was not creeped out but nervous as dean sat reading elicots' journal . i just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it is sanctity . elicot did not appear . maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place ( like elicot's office ) should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters . when they separate i want to scream . . . 'that is how you die ! always stay together and watch each others backs ! ' but they do not listen to me : o the elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch . it's prime-time show but i do wish the horror of elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further . especially because of the lighting goofs i gave this a 4 . sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying . the lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking . i understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on . have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room . blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like elicot's finger power . seriously , mcg could have done better .",0,4

"i passed this one on the shelf a few times , looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes ( with tiny names ) on the front and wondering if i was missing something . the other night it was on one of the movie channels , and i tuned in . i missed nothing . i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes . perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that . given the slow , plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 , i seriously doubt it . the lead character starts the movie in classic ""i do not know how to start my movie"" style , with a long , tiresome monologue about how he does not want to get sued . it's not funny . it's not even remotely funny . others have commented on the ""san franclisco"" bit; ok , a small chuckle the first time he says it . then he grinds it into the ground , smiling at the camera like it is the funniest thing ever written . get over yourself . in fact , i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film . don't assume familiarity with your audience . familiarity is _earned_ , much like respect . from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp . i did not realize he is jewish; it is a discredit to jewish comedians to call this ""jewish humor"" . it's just unfunny humor . just because you are jewish does not mean you have a knack for the comedy . a wasp , spalding gray , does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy , so obviously it is not about ethnicity . if one of the bits i had seen had worked , i might have stuck around . but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with , then listing them for five long minutes , does not make a great movie . this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of ""office space"" . don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing . just say no to ""haiku tunnel"" .",0,1

"i approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised . it is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years , especially ""strictly ballroom"" . while the music is nice and the dancing colourful , for me the movie is not about dancing . it is about the very japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families . here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life . he is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing . also japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted , at least eventually , by family and audience . attitudes to ballroom dancing , as conveyed in the film , are definitely non-western , though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to japan . the cultural contrasts are thus intriguing . even without the cultural insights , the colour , the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch .",1,9
"ok , i love bad horror . i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of . demonicus , or house of the dead - those were bad enough to make fun of . severed was not . it was worse . ( spoilers - who cares ? ) my friend and i sat through the entire film , and i have a number of comments , both in the ""this sucks"" style and in the realm of actual critiques . plot ( sort of ) - there's a guy in this city ( which is possibly seattle , see comment below ) who is running around and cutting off heads . he's been doing this for over a year ( i'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you very much ) , possibly two or three years . one head a week . and the police are just now calling in a ""specialist"" ( who once refers to himself as a psychic , but that never comes up again ) . schya right ! feds take over after , what , three connected homicides ? after nearly a hundred similar killings we would be under freaking martial law ! ! ! ! ! anyway , this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time , and the two of them come to the conclusion that it is baron samedi , a voodoo spirit , who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body ( and then presumably take over the world - or possibly just go to disneyland ) . um . setting - where is this happening ? well , if you are not from seattle , you might not realize that at the bar/rave ( occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members ) , there is a poster for a local radio station , and that in the highly-entertaining , ""pulp fiction""esqe dialog ( as if ) between the two cops ( yes , the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick ) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made . being from seattle , i apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame . ok , here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer ( not published , do not go looking for my name in the imdb ) , i do research . lots of research . and unlike the writers of this movie , i know that baron samedi - while a voudon loa ( spirit ) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated ( by various christian oppressors ) with ""satan"" - is actually a ""loki""-like trickster god . in other words , he does not cut off heads . besides , a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants . their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa . not to mention , if he is already possessed someone , why make a new body ? also , if baron samedi got a body , he would not go around cutting off heads , he would get some good rum and cigars and par-tay ! ! ! in summary , the only thing they did get ( surprisingly ) right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading ( used only to show that the voodoo chick is ""spooky"" ) they did not screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do . again , i've done research . ( anyone remember the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - ""the lovers - you will soon fall madly in love . . . "" and all that nonsense ? ) if you made it this far through my comments , i congratulate you . and i'm sorry again . i'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me , so please do not .",0,1
"great fun . i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film . we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie . in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff ( there are many more examples of this lingo ) and because they keep repeating the same jokes ( with different twists ) they get funnier and funnier . in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next . until half of the film was over we did not even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing , but we sure had a good time . the house was loaded ( appr . 250 people ) and i think about half of them did not like it and the other half loved the film . if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it . apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5 . 6 imdb rating it has at the time i write this , but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up . 7 . 0 is reasonable i guess , i would give it an 8 out of 10 .

"directed by samuel fuller , who also wrote the screenplay , pickup on south street is a tough , brutal , well made film about a pickpocket ( richard widmark ) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents . also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover richard kiley . it's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie . as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties ( and who also sells information ) she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination . its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won . this should have been the role that copped it for her !",1,10

"dog bite dog is not going to be for everyone , but i really enjoyed it . full of slapping , stabbing and shooting ( but do not worry the lead's a terrible shot ) , it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia . edison cheng plays pang , a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister . despite being filthy from his journey , he is almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant . if this sounds wildly implausible to you , you should probably avoid this film . it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief , and i had a lot more fun for it . chasing pang down is wai ( sam lee ) , a young , edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke . wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him , and his father , a legendary good cop , is in a coma following a drug deal that went south ( the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings ) . there are a car crashes , lots of killings , and a strange and awkward love story on offer here , all played out in almost comic-book style . i suspect the humour was deliberate ( nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd ) , though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members . there are at least three points where the film might have ended , and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing , or the deletion of one of the narrative threads ( the light-hearted stuff worked well , so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers ) . i'm inclined to give it a ( high ) pass , however , if only because of the ending i've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment . this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous",1,8
"this movie is not just bad , not just corny , it is repulsive . something about daphne , about the creepy call-girl , about the whole damn ( and i use the word literally ) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress . this film makes my skin crawl , makes me regret having reproductive organs , and makes me feel unclean . one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept . a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results , rather than the clich worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish , is a truly fascinating film idea . thought : the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights . during the day , bright lights do not show up well , so they could go anywhere . count the hobgoblins : four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio , and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie . discussion question : if you had a frigid , demanding , unappreciative girlfriend , would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead ? explain .",0,1
"i remember watching this film , thinking was so interesting . i really wanted to know what happens next . i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short . we start in a school yard . . two friends are debating on skipping class . kid b says to kid a ""lets not go to class today . "" and kid a declines , claiming they could miss something really important . so kid b skips and kid a goes to class . when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn . they were going to learn the meaning of life . she gives everyone a pamphlet , and when she gets to kid a , she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share . well , the kid will not share , so kid a goes looking for the teacher . when he finally finds her , he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is . i suggest everyone watch this short . it will only take 8 minutes from your life , but the message is so important , it could help you for a life time .",1,10
"this film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of ""guns , germs and steel"" , explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe . the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours . i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes . there are completely useless scenes of : professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars , professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly , professor jared diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly . was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of ""professor jared diamond ? "" . this part of the documentary was so bad , it could have been a spoof . the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital . none of this helps me understand his theory of ""guns , germs and steel . "" btw , ""guns , germs and steel"" is said about 100 times . ""can the europeans guns , germs and steel get them out of this dire situation ? stay tuned and find out ! "" when he finally gets down to business , his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring . europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands , because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons . do i really need a professor to convince me of this ? the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting , but the coverage is paper-thin . in the end , i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-europeans are as capable as europeans . if i'm not a racist , i already know this . if i'm a racist , jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements . i do not think adults are the intended audience for this documentary . kids may enjoy this more than i , though . i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary .",0,4
"i am a big movie fan . i like movies of all types . this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen . i get that it follows the book closely , which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie . especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once . these characters are not quirky , they are mentally ill . the things that happen are not funny , they are disturbing; especially considering they are supposed to be true . this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums , another movie i hated , only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny . i will never get those hours back . i wanted to wash my brain after watching .",0,1
"""the groove tube"" was one of only two ken shapiro movies , the other one being the equally zany ""modern problems"" . this one is just a full-scale parody of tv . aside from shapiro - who apparently did not do anything after ""modern problems"" - the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winkler's cousin richard belzer . the three cast members ( plus some other people in smaller roles ) appear in various skits . one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol-spoofing commercial , in which he is describing the medicine as his wife strips , and it ends with her humping him . there's also a pornographic news program , an irritating cooking show , and the epic tale of some drug dealers . anyway , the whole thing's just a real hoot . in my opinion , the three best tv-spoofing movies are this one , plus ""tunnelvision"" and ""kentucky fried movie"" ( although i might also include ""the truman show"" ) . really funny . i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro .",1,10

"first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie ( nothing less than this available ) . the film fails in every department be it screenplay , direction , characterization or acting . 1 ) to start with , the name of the movie is really c class ( though the movie itself match up to the name ) . 2 ) amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character . 3 ) in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50 , 000 on him ( which was convincing ) . here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban ( amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute ( with all automatic guns ) . making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time does not look convincing . 4 ) as for nisha kothari , somebody needs to tell her that she does not know acting . why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again ? 5 ) mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do . 6 ) sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie . 7 ) legendry role played by lila misra ( mausi of basanti ) in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy . ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie . enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag . 8 ) should not say anything about modern jai and veeru . . pathetic to the greatest extent . to summarize , i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic . please do not waste money and time on this movie . i think watching aap ka surror ( which i thought was the worst movie possible ) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters , bad songs and miserable direction . thanks , saurabh",0,1

"i could not believe how lame & pointless this was . basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie , hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie . this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion . i think keanu reeves must have taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix . uma thurman looked very simple & humble . luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons . i will not write anything about the story of the movie , but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb . i would give this movie a 2 / 10 . before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4 . 0/10 , & now i know why . a very disappointing movie . don't buy it even if you see it for under $5 .",0,2
"after reading several comments , i felt i had to add in my two cents as well . ""sorrow lost"" is one of the most memorable shorts i think i have ever seen . i had gotten the chance to see this at the new york independent film festival . i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional . the story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time . the story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father . she is soon given the choice to ""stop"" him by a demon played by ""witchblade's eric etebari . "" having watched the show , i was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character . i never knew he could act so well ! his character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive . the acting was absolutely superb by him . the girl's was okay and the father's was decent . there is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future . the effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing . i wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this . it is rare you get to see such a high quality short . the opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film . this is not to say that it is not without its flaws - i thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long . but this stuck in my head days after watching it . there are very few shorts with this level of quality .",1,9
"todd rohal is a mad genius .

"national lampoon's class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters , lots of laughs , and some great music from chuck berry . when walter bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion . one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl , a horny fat guy , the high school beauty , the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool . this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i would not recommend it for young children but it is a great movie for teens . if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score , complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion . if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun ( and who does not ) then this movie should be on your movies to see list . ++",1,9
"i do not think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions . i tolerated the first season . unfortunately , this is a show about lawyers who are not really lawyers . god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows , which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show . it just made me gag a bit . that aside , spader and shatner , who are supposed to be the stars of the show , are the most annoying . while this might be a compliment in some situations , it is certainly not here . their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first . but since that is what they are doing literally all the time , i've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get . trying to intersperse some serious , dramatic , and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show . alan shore's flamboyant and gratuitous ""public service announcements"" where he spouts off his opinions do not impress . denny crane is just annoying . i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit . i'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show is attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care . i think the show is writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start . the thing is , i do not care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well , but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more . i'm not a teenager anymore , and i think this show is promising if its goal was not to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings . of course , i'm writing this after i realized that it is really not gonna get much better than this . it's a shame because it is one of those shows i'd love to love .",0,2

"although i do not usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this , i happened to catch the 1994 version of angels in the outfield ( aito ) on cable one saturday morning just as it was starting . being an adrien brody fan , i was curious to see what brody was like as a youth of 21 ( 20 when he filmed it , i suppose ) in this early role as danny hemmerling , utility infielder for the california angels ( in the 1951 original , the hard-luck baseball team was the pittsburgh pirates . the name change is a nice touch , since it turns the title into wordplay ) . i decided to give the flick a chance , and it turned out to be a pretty painless , even amiable experience , with a decent balance of laughs , tears , sweetness , and baseball-based excitement . also , my 7-year-old daughter liked the angel effects ! : - ) directed by mike nesmith's frequent collaborator william dear , aito is the story of roger ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'er-do-well dad ( the convincingly sleazy dermot mulroney ) sarcastically says they will be a family again once the last-place california angels win the pennant . soon roger starts seeing real angels at the angels' games , led by christopher lloyd , whose usual zany , eccentric irreverence keeps aito from plummeting irretrievably into the schmaltz zone . crusty manager george knox ( danny glover in world-weary , exasperated mode ) is a hard sell , but once the team starts winning , he believes roger's angel sightings , and soon knox has roger and his cute li'l pal and fellow foster kid j . p . ( the adorable milton davis jr . ) at every angels game for good luck . knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language , as much to appease the angels as for the kids' sake , resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along . predictable obstacles ensue , such as obnoxious sportcaster ranch wilder ( jay o . sanders ) trying to make trouble for knox because of the angel angle . sure , it all works out fine for our heroes in the end , but they are so darn amiable you do not mind ! : - ) baby-faced brody has a couple of good lines ( i especially like his exchange with glover about the emotional impact of the national anthem at a ballgame ) as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat . brody is not the only future star in aito's lineup : his teammates include matthew mcconaughey and neal mcdonough , and of course , young gordon-levitt went on to co-star in tv's 3rd rock from the sun as well as such films as 10 things i hate about you . the always-amusing taylor negron and oscar winners ( but not for this film : - ) brenda fricker and ben johnson lend able support . if you are a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars , aito '94 will do nicely .",1,7
"here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching . and mostly , it is for two reasons . one , it concentrates of young people , very young people . people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time , or at least think they are . all of us have been there in our lives and ""the man in the moon"" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories , maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced . the second reason is that is a love triangle . and i do believe that as teens , it is the most dramatic . and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love , or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs , will believe it for the rest of their lives . the cast of ""the man in the moon"" is full of great talented names . it stars sam waterston , who is truly a versatile actor , well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict , yet caring and wise fathers as in this film . also there is tess harper , jason london , and a young , young reese witherspoon . you look at the young , talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road , she is going to win the academy award . all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay , they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations . as if it all really happened . this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often . love story or not . i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way .",1,9
"this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul . what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character , who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative . yea , though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death , he fears no evil . a rod and staff are there to comfort him . in the end , he is saved from the dregs of humanity . at the bottom is fagin , the most wicked of the lot . fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once , but twice , yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price . fagin is worse than bill sikes , because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers . in the middle is oliver . his innocence is unsullied , but untried as well . the best is nancy . lacking in judgment , she ignores bill sikes' violent nature out of her deep need for love . yet unlike fagin , at the probable cost of her own life , she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill . things are not as they seem . in my opinion , this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability . i would give this film a ""10 , "" but its '70's made-for-tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting . overall , a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences .",1,9

"cq was the worst film i saw this year . nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say . this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro . to filmmaking class . his father makes great films . his sister made a good one . but brother roman ? no ! one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard's le m pris ( contempt ) . while coppola , jr . did take the same idea , a film about film , he tried too hard to make himself seem european , artsy , and witty , when it is all really just kitsch . the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film , like he is either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him . schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director . depardieu is alright . the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is , surprisingly , not the b-movie scenes , but rather one which takes place in italy; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car , driving around picking up and dropping off random people . this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof . or rip-off . or both . the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out , the ending was tagged on for the sake of a ""twist"" or artistic value . . . i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself , and not in the way it intended . no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever , which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before . i cannot believe it could have been worse than this . if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films . any of them . the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film . lil' romy , for the sake of cinema , please go back to directing your cousin's music videos . leave the godfathers to daddy .",0,2

' . yeah , there were continuity errors about ( mainly with ms . rochon's ever-changing wardrobe ) , but for an indie slasher it is not that bad . i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless , but that was just a gimmick . the dialog was overly think and painful at times . just do not have high expectations going into this , and it will not be that bad . and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated .",0,4

"this movie was so bad i do not know whether to laugh or cry . i had high hopes for horrorfest that year , which was also the first year i attended horrorfest , and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level . mad kudos to the advertisers because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year . the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen ( the other ones i saw were unrest , dark ride , and reincarnation ) . the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot , only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire . which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film . and to make the plot even more ridiculous , they add in a set of horny twins who cannot wait to take a 'bite' out of one another , and some deadly creature locked in the basement , which if i had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film , i would have left the theater halfway into the movie . complete waste of money and time . cut forty minutes out of this film , and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this . absolute rubbish ! so bad that two years later , i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen . also , while you are reading this , steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future . the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere . horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who cannot make it onto the big screen , and all the crap about 'stuff they do not show you in theaters' , they were not referring to blood or guts , or horror . . . they were referring to the movies themselves . because they are horrendous . think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival , but for horror movies . sorry for all the 'hate' , but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money .",0,2
"i loved this movie . it was so well done ! great acting and drama and historically accurate . i love romy schneider movies . this one rocks , not as great as sissi but still rocks ! and scorpiolina , she commented and said french dubbing . well this is originally a german movie not french . so yea . second of all there was a plot , maybe your not familiar with history . oh and her mother played the part of her governess , not her teacher . and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria , maybe u missed that detail . but anyway . . . . yea the history in this movie is great , i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating ! i love all the historical stuff . like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom . and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the ""new type of dance"" waltzing . when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close . yea her governess was like oh my god ! and also the clothes , i love the clothes . the styles are great , hoop skirts are awesome . and of course romy always looks very pretty .",1,10
"it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money . not what his fans ought to remember him by . brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work . brando is the warden of a local prison which in america , when it is located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area . that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout . unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges , his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters . even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers , charlie sheen and thomas haden church , their hearts still belong to daddy . not to fear because brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have . what to do , but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury . although free money has some moments of humor , for most of the time it is quite beneath the talents of all those involved . some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter , but also straight arrow fbi agent . of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century . were it not for brando's presence and were it some 40 years earlier , free money would be playing the drive-in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they are being satirized . or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them .",0,3

"well . . . easily my favourite tv series ever . call me a walking mail clich but include violence , mafia , sex , gambling , drugs etc . on a show and you are already winning points on in my book . combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you have ever seen on the small screen , add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind ( and a few brains a long the way ) and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with . above all stand two actors , james gandolfini as tony soprano , and edie falco as his wife carmela . . . as for gandolfini , he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express , if you have not seen him as tony yet see it now ! i can go on and on and on about every character in the show , the psychological brilliance , the gripping scenes etc . but you would not be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld , that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more .",1,10
"my observations : vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful , exotic and fantastic . jeanette wore it well , and got even with naive nelson . boat crashing into his balcony served him right . costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well , especially by today's standards . 1942 costume designer did great job . main song theme just lovely . caution to negative posters : 1942 was time of ww ii; pearl harbor happened year before . u . s . just coming out of great depression; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing , dance and yes , fantastic fantasy . despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl , snuffing out freedoms . thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend . movie going was a privileged treat , in those depressing times . when you , negative posters , become actors or even movie stars , then you have room to talk and criticize . jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time . angel wings wonderful , on the real angel . rl wings at costume party not so hot , but great on jeanette considering the sl . beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson , as always . jeanette dancing was a pure delight . 15/10",1,10
"i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line was not good at all . the play of the actors were not any better . of course shahrukh khan was there yet he was not enough to make this movie ""credible"" and interesting . i've read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert ""madame bovary"" yet for me i did not see it matching with the indian mentality . in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time , not to waste our time and change our mood into worse . i just cannot understand how it could get such a ""high"" vote with an average of 6 . 8/10 . so it is the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it ! you will just waste your time unless if you like ""dark movie"" with ""strange and non sense story"" .",0,3
"i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney . this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it . i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then , , this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once , i really hoped i would get to see it again . the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory . to this day , i never did see it after that day back in the 70s , in fact , i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me . i loved it and want my kids to see it . does anybody know where i can find it ?",1,10
"where to begin ? how best to describe just how awful this movie is ? ? ? let's start with the campy hick humor . it is not very funny . add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse . pity poor art carney , who should have known better than to do this movie . and then there is the plot . a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper . at least they get what they want . . . and then , just when the movie should end , they cannot come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well , i will not ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie . there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a ""b"" movie or perhaps worse . gailard sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role . that's a sure sign that the movie probably will not be very good . if nothing else , the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor . let's just say this . this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared . and none are worse than roadie .",0,1

"unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of ""cruel intentions"" and ""wild things"" , but it is not nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics . it's about the acting sheriff , artie ( taye diggs ) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class univesity , but to keep it on the down low . as he digs deeper he thinks it is much more than it at first glance seems to be . we follow alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . at about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for that . my grade : d eye candy : dominique swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of ""happy campers"" ) ; another girl is topless anti-eye candy : more men ass than girl tit",0,3
"the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more . of course it is not going to be an oscar nominated film , it is just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes . the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert . it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film , which includes a lot of violence ( which is basically the whole film ) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing , and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience . i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment , and that only . although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on , as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake . the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment , something to pass time if you are bored , and nothing else . 4/10",0,4
"i do not hand out ten star ratings easily . a movie really has to impress me , and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that . furthermore , this trilogy has come together so nicely , that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time . though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels , they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement . the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete , yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours . from the moment that the opening title appeared , i knew we were in for a ride . paul greengrass has done it again . everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again : the action , the dialogue , and of course the shaky camera . however for me , that last one was never a problem . i think it adds to the suspense . i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd , simply because it is genius . it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion , and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie , and altogether , an unforgettable trilogy .",1,10

"this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods . one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus . suddenly , the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves .

"this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released . there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date . however , i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends , until we could appreciate it again on dvd . actually , i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common . therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd . firstly , there was a theory about how naives our generation was . secondly , i think there is something more . i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers , specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre . this is the mutilation , the idea which gives coherence to the film; the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture . i remember how sick the sensation was , when the monster rip kurt's arm out . and at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins . another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes , no matter if the action is on a secret lab , a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body , a striper dressing room , and so on . may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things . for example , in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fianc e's head a more accurate work , made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting . same thing with all action scenes , including the one of kurt's arm . furthermore , something could be done with the monster's make up . some remakes have been good; i think in this case an attempt would worth while . nevertheless , the black and white tones should be conserved .",1,9

"yes , talk about bad sequels . rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining ""honey i shrunk the kids"" . the concept basically plays the same way as the first film , but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore . if you think this sounds interesting , think again . the movie is boring at best , right down an embarrassment at worst . first of all , the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet . the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis . the actress playing his wife has changed , the actors playing the kids have changed , the ones playing the neighbors have changed . . . you name it . they try to make us believe this is the same family , but the results are puzzling to say the least . second , the story is a rehash of the first one , with not one bit of originality . all the few jokes ( and there is barely any ) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from ""honey i shrunk the kids"" . third problem , the special effects . i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget , but they are pathetic , way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series . you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area , but you will probably end up cringing most of the time . fourth problem , to locate the action inside the house is just boring . only few things happen , and when they happen , they are not thrilling at all . the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature , the grass , and the bugs that live in it . in this one , the adults ( which come up as rather boring , compared to the kids ) deal with dust , a cockroach and a cockroach trap . disgusting . i do not know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives , except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new . i'm warning you : leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay : getting dust on the shop's shelves .",0,2

"" while looking at someone off-screen . she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day . even if the poor kid had any acting skills , the scene is completely unbelievable . the little girl would not even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage--surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies , while she calmly stands there ! ! natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified , running away from the bloody carnage ! are we suppose to be horrified or laugh . . . ? ! one particularly goofy detail , that gives the scene an snl satire tone , is the father hanging , with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek . he looks like a fish on a hook ! the unintentionally funny details , make the whole scene come across as fake and silly . in fantasy la-la-land , mothers and daughters are the same age ! another funny detail , is that you see a central character--the little girl's mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene , that occurs 20+ years later , she looks exactly the same ! she is still young and beautiful , and now the same age as her daughter ! i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors . i do not know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles ! who was the targeted audience ? the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows . it is also a strange way to start a movie that , for the rest of the time , seems targeted to romance novel reading females . weird inconsistency in tone !",0,3

"originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and i was not disappointed that way ( except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes ) . as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays ( as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic ) . in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices . this dilemma is introduced by a young british-born teen girl - jasminder ( jess ) - of east-indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer . the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore ( in a nice way ) her hopes and fears for her future . the multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships . in summary , the soccer scenes are great ( lots to learn in slowmo ) and while i did not need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going .",1,8

""flight of fury"" offers the duo of ciera payton ( who has a very sexy face , with luscious lips to match angelina jolie's ) and katie jones , and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling ! and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them , it is because the rest of the movie , although passable , is so unexciting that it is hard to find much else to talk about . ironically , the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself , who looks as if he cannot even be bothered to try to pretend to care . this being a military-type actioner , there is very little fighting in it , and he does not fit into his role ( a stealth fighter pilot , ""the best in the world"" , of course ) very well , which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .

"this is such a great film ! never mind the low rating here . i really have no idea where that came from , they must be discussing a different film then . because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure . it's story was so original and charming . . i really cannot think of anything bad to say about it . maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'' , but , i saw this with my sister and my mother , and we all were taken by it . the acting was also very good , and that is hard to do in a film like this . but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic . i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting . it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy , but i absolutely had no problem with that this time . even more so , i adored him . everyone who loves a good thriller/drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film , no question about that ! anyone wanting to see a film with 80% bloodshed , should go rent something else , though . . but i guess the title already kind of gives that away . this is a love story , not saw 3 . i give this film 4 out of five stars ! ! ! good job ! ! ! xxx enjoy !",1,9
"romantic comedies can really go either way , you know ? you'll see one that is really sappy , and you will think you want something more realistic . then , you will see one that is realistic , but it might be too dull to keep you interested . or maybe you will see one that does everything right , but just fails to make you smile . romantic comedies are tough movies . you go into them with a lot of expectations , and usually , whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you . of course , if you have got a girl next to you , and you are a guy like me , it probably does not matter all that much whether the movie's any good , you have got other things on your mind . for you , i say , ""go get her , tiger ! "" for the rest of us , i say , ""see _a guy thing_ . "" it's a lot of fun . because _a guy thing_ knows you are going in to this movie with expectations , so it does not pretend that its ""guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams , and it is not his wife ! "" plot is going to make everyone happy . sure , maybe you like it , but maybe it does not ring true , or you think it is cruel . _a guy thing_ covers that . what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time , so if you do not the main plotline , you have still got something to make you smile . whether we are talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen , like larry miller ( pretty woman , best in show ) , james brolin ( traffic ) , julie hagerty ( airplane ! ) , david koechner ( saturday night live and conan o'brien regular , dirty work , austin powers ii ) or thomas lennon ( the state and viva variety ) , or new faces like shawn hatosy ( the faculty ) , or colin foo ( saving silverman ) , we are talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation , steal the show , time after time , and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days . and that is not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along , because it is very sweet and terribly well done . jason lee ( mallrats , chasing amy , dogma , etc . ) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control , and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is . a lot of the success of the movie , though , falls on julia stiles , the right girl in the right place at the wrong time , and she wears it well . not since , gosh , i do not know when , have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy . of course , it is all in the closeups , the voice , and the subtle smiles , but it is magical , and it is one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place . but julie stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity . this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types , makes them fall over each other to make you laugh , and then comes through with a great deal of heart . a guy thing is a movie you have definitely seen before , and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it . we have not really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl . a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge , often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play . for the record , it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy , so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it . and guys , i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie . i'm not going to spoil it for you , but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema , i suggest you just say ""it's a guy thing , "" and leave it at that .",1,8
"at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children . one can see toots is not in the best of health , but he goes along . when he dies suddenly , may's world , begins to spin out of control . the film directed by roger michell , based on a screen play by hanif kureshi , is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she does not even know it existed until now . may's life as a suburban wife was probably boring . obviously her sexual life was next to nothing . we get to know she is had a short extra marital affair , then nothing at all . when may loses her husband she cannot go back home , so instead , she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter's home . it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren , her daughter's occasional lover . darren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known . may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes . may , who at the beginning of the film is dowdy , suddenly starts dressing up , becoming an interesting and attractive woman . she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before . having known a couple of cases similar to this story , it came as no surprise to me to watch may's reaction . her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce , a widower , ends up frustratingly for may , who realizes how great her sex is with darren . the younger man , we figure , is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may . finally , the daughter , helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made . the film is a triumph for the director . in anne reid , mr . michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may . also amazing is daniel craig . he knows how darren will react to the situation . anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back . oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helen's class and is quite effective . the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind .",1,8

( kidman rules ! ! ! ! ) . ben chaplin is great here , he is extremely likable , had a cool character , had very good chemistry with kidman , the only thing i did not like was him taking out his anger out on kidman , even though what she did was wrong , and i loved how he got revenge in the end ! . vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain , yes he was ott , but he was very intense and quite creepy at times , this role was perfect for him . mathieu kassovitz is ok here , but did not have much to do . rest of the cast are fine . overall i highly recommend this one ! . ***1/2 out of 5",1,8
"i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together , the talk is not of the master's great films like ""north by northwest"" or ""strangers on a train"" , but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931 , obscure and seriously flawed , which showcases the great director in fledgling form . emily and fred hill ( joan barry and harry kendall ) are a middle-class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot; she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle , saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun . just ask richard hannay , roger o . thornhill , or marion crane . well , marion's indisposed at the moment , but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight , setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme , and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element , in this case domestic drama rather than suspense , but the two do not cohere , at least not here . the hills are a dull , flat couple , with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies berg re , in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film , they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers . ""the curtain's gone up too soon ! "" gasps emily . ""they are not dressed . "" when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise , it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing , even if the people they partner off with are drips , too . emily's man , gordon ( percy marmont ) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs , which he suggests be filled by emily . fred's girl ""the princess"" ( betty amann ) has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five of the clock shadow . there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger , a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come . everything is shot in an abrupt manner , with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that does not come off , and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off , they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged-together rickshaws , one of many clunky attempts at symbolism . emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character , in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon , but mostly because she is among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes , her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion . matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with , and presumably repair their relationship . only they are not active participants in the resolution , and except for the fate of a friendly cat , nothing about the ending resonates . at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s , and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food . ""rich and strange"" is hitchcock paying his dues , and learning his trade , one for scholars but not casual film goers .",0,3
"when i started watching ""fay grim"" , i had no idea that it was a sequel to ""henry fool"" . now , the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel . but one has arrived , and it is quite good . i assume that you have seen the original , so i will not explain it . this one starts with fay ( parker posey ) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry ( thomas jay ryan ) . simon ( james urbaniak ) is still in jail . one day , the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school . but this is no ordinary toy . it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie . and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than ""syriana"" . i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here . maybe this one does not quite reach the original's quality , but it certainly takes a good look at what is going on in the world . and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel . also starring jeff goldblum .",1,7

"i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch's works , for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical ""lynch-elements . "" having seen most of his works , i naively thought i could predict lynch's next step . i was dead wrong . dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch . still , after my recovery from the first shock , i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character , and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities , cruelty , brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality , being emphasized by distorting it . there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize , for they are either disgusting or horrible , however , they are surrounding us , so i take the courage to say , dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces . this is not a movie to enjoy , though you will sometimes laugh out of a strange , perverted sense of humor , this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe , with its simplicity , morbidity and absurdity . take it as it is , you do not have to like it . it just exists . and finally , if you are attentive enough , you will find elements typical to lynch as well . i recommend it for tolerant people ! ! !",1,9
"a beautiful new print of ""zabriskie point"" is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter . it's time for a full evaluation of the film . let's hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful ""extras"" will be out in the near future . i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore . this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a ""near-miss"" masterpiece . the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late '60's los angeles , i lived there then , and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place . kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work . the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes . it is forbidden to those under 16 ( or 18 , i cannot remember ) . i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print . spoiler -- i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut . what appears today seems rather tame by current standards . there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film . before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts , etc . antonioni was very daring to do this . i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors mark frechette and daria halprin . this time frechette did not bother me . halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues . much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me . one shot is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen . of course , there is actual staged footage , but not all that much . i'm still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane . it looks like he really did some of the flying - there is no blue screen or double in some shots . i hope to get back to see the film a second time . recommended highly to all antonioni fans .",1,7
"the comment by ""eliz7212-1"" hits the proverbial ""nail on the head"" for this turkey of a program . but it is a hoot to watch william shatner ""cavort"" and ""dance"" ( yes , the "" "" marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does ) . this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing , or so , to see shatner , who seems to have taken ""camp"" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself . but the guy is funny . the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls , will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre , with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more . i watched the first contestant , who was annoying , and literally ""dumber than a : post , "" yet through sheer luck , walked away with a quarter mil or so . the second contestant , somewhat more intelligent , but who'd be lucky to gain $1 , 000 on jeopardy ! , got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he did not know , and thereby left with zilch . this plethora of game shows , which dangle , and sometimes award , large sums to everyday individuals , are admittedly a cheap effort , overall , to attempt to woo viewers . even if the host is well-compensated , and they give away six figures in an average episode , i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures , per episode , with some big residual deals as well . but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long . this one has already pretty much reached this point . i think his offerings , especially with james spader , and the others on ""boston legal"" should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatner's offerings . again , the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance , perhaps one time; that should be sufficient .",0,4
"there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship , stuff he dare not dream about . as doctor edward morbius , pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier . since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter , anne francis . they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell . the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin . the machinery they left behind is still functioning . maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion . i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it is as fresh as it was in 1956 . the terms would change , we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive , courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek . we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship . it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey . it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change . the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one , about mortal beings trying to play god . you cannot write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot . this mechanical marvel , put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day . he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space . his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny . robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar , but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea . forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b . demille . classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction . my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who is sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he is dealing with . never miss this one whenever it is broadcast .",1,9

"i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod . if you do not expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you will not be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' ( suzanna arquette , who obviously does not want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter ) . mandy's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . ( there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio ) . and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and did not need a double to prove it . mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature ( allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother's lover ) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses ( always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason ) . mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish - and maybe french , although i do not know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . vambo drule .",1,9
"this splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm . it is a first-class adventure for many reasons , i suggest--fine photography , strong imaginative qualities , a delightful cast , good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline . johnny weissmuller plays tarzan , a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation; but he is honest , loyal , brave and very courageous , and he needs to be during this narrative . as jane parker , his wife who had been jane porter in the novels , maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively , as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality . the effect of the lighting , the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual . this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back-lot which really works . the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them , emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated . one is harry holt , still in love with her , who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her , but she refuses to leave tarzan . tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals , in scenes that look like a humanized king king . the group claim to want to hunt animals , and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point , the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds . tarzan is shot , left for dead; and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous ""elephant's graveyard"" . but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions . tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene , he saves jane and what is left of the expedition , who return home little richer but much wise , as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband . the film was directed by set-design wizard cedric gibbons , and quite beautifully too . his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film , which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish . neil hamilton is a very good harry , paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad . forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally . an unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well . recommended .",1,8
"i have three comments to make about this film , which i discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at blockbuster . first off , it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works . some have , as kubrick did with ""lolita"" , gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work . of course that cannot happen here; kraft-ebing is long dead . some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new , unrelated direction ( the recent adaptation of ""tristram shandy"" comes to mind here ) . you can dumb it down - the film of ""slaughterhouse five"" is to my mind an example of that . or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes . that would be the approach of woody allen's ""everything you wanted to know about sex"" , and , arguably , this film . upon consideration , it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like ""psychopathia sexualis"" . the potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed . and so it is here . point two is the cinematic style . some would call it an ""homage"" to murnau , pabst , carl dreyer , etc . , but i think it more crude than that . its far too heavy handed and self-conscious to be effective for long . it is eventually just annoying . point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation . how did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring ? i found the film impossible to pay attention to , and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well . i do not want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless , but i have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material , the overt copying of filmic styles , and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level ( possibly for fear of being accused of titillation ) . the film is a dubious exercise from the start and does not really work for me , i'm sorry to say .",0,2
"william powell's final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind . it's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why . the philo vance murders by s . s . van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr . van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder . this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out . had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series , he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances . it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim . as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found . i did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how . powell has a lovely group of suspects , as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery . people like paul cavanaugh , helen vinson , ralph morgan , mary astor , fill their cast roles well . warner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance . it does not hold a candle to this one . as this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can .",1,8
"the problem is the role of the characters in the film . man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself . the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped , treated like animals , and yet given such a shallow , stereotypical role within the film . . . the kidnapper ( british anthropologist ) ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies . . . no notion of how the two hostages feel , of their point of view , of their ordeal . . . i find it is a shallow film , with a one sided fundamentally racist view . . . it never manages to move away from the 'white mans' view",0,1
"madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw . but the best part is he has not forgotten to give the ingredients . it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now . page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it . madhavi ( konkan sharma ) is a journalist and enjoys her work . a simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl . she covers the page 3 ( celebrity page ) of nation today , where she has a very supportive editor deepak suri ( boman irani . ) but life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit . omigosh ! a whole new world was waiting for her there . she is shocked , excited , stunned with the revelation . her reaction has resulted in losing the job . at the end she is back to page 3 . now when she meets any celebrity in a party , she knows the actual looks of each , hidden under the illusive face . the movie has a message and it is crude . the audience needs to get it in their own color . the theme and the screenplay was fantastic . there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences . like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition , the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom . the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it . charu mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity , it leaves an impact . the set selections could have been better . the songs do not stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background . atul kulkarni has a small role with high-impact . there were a few flaws visible . atul kulkarni explaining konkan sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence . there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach . the meeting between thapar and his daughter does not call for acting . that scene looks very unprofessional . overall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident . that may spoil your mood .",1,9
"i recently watched this , but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about , what the topic was . . . . . in short - i had no idea what it was . was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine . . . . . well , it was both . it started a little slow , but i think that is because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing . but it quickly sucked me in . the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history . mainly how we ( american's ) learn history that is not really true - and how we got to learn what we did . he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained , and interested . i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be . i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo . i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are ""taught"" in the same type of manner as this episode .",1,10
"here's a gritty , get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington . he's three personalities here : a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary , then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge . the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico , where kidnappings of children occur regularly ( at least according to the movie . ) he becomes attached to the kid , played winningly by the child actress of our day , dakota fanning . when fanning is kidnapped in front of him , washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one . beware : this film is not for the squeamish . this is stylish film-making , which is good and bad . i liked it , but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache . i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view , but it is ( the shaky camera ) not for all tastes . besides the two stars , there is the always-interesting christopher walken , in an uncharacteristically low-key role , and a number of other fine actors . the film panders to the base emotions in all of us , but it works .",1,8
"basically this is an overlong , unfunny , action/comedy . first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie ( 1 ) and the sequel had it is moments . unfortunately white chicks does not even deliver half the laughs . the humour in it is absolutely crude . if you like burping , farting , stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this . when it is not crude it is idiotic . the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me , totally unfunny , simply idiotic . however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend ( otherwise i would not have bothered ) . the story is undeniably thin , it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant . i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film , the laughs do not come quick enough . some jokes are dragged out too long when they are more disgusting than funny in the first place . if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this . if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie , airplane , hotshots 1 + 2 . 1/10 completely unfunny , thin storyline , a film that seems to be based on one idea ( i . e . what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film ? ) but simply did not have enough material .",0,1
"i'll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived ""thriller . "" a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo , let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs . a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes , although the art direction is not half bad . the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst . no tension , no suspense , no dread , no fear , no empathy , no catharsis , no nothing . a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom , but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer . i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing . good for late-night , zoned-out viewing only . you have been warned .",0,3
"nice character development in a pretty cool milieu . being a male , i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it , but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start . it is not as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher . what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters . each has their own ""thing"" that they contend with . once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs , they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion . what i enjoyed about this movie is that it did not go for cheap comedy when it could have . it did not try to pound a lesson into us . the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light . i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly , but , within this world , it needed to happen . good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people .",1,8
". . . so i thought i'd throw in a few words about william mcnamara . not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it is obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less . there's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies . there's a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff , with only his hands cupped over his groin . william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side , but he has a nice , generous handful of a booty . also , there is a moment when he is getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada . if you are inclined to do so , and come on , half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a ""road trip"" are . i'd just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity . can william mcnamara act ? heck if i know .",0,3
"marvelous james stewart , vera miles vehicle . what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film . the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency . it deals with airplane bomb plots , killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain , fighting organized crime , nazis and communists in that order . the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles . they raise 3 children as miles' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment . look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton . years later , he appeared as mr . robinson in 1967's ""the graduate . "" the film has nothing but praise for j . edgar hoover . he certainly brought the fbi up to par . true , this could be viewed as right-wing propaganda , especially with stewart's real-life republican views , but it is well done , historically informative , and the view of the family so well depicted .",1,10
"kenneth branagh's ""hamlet"" hits all the marks . the acting is magnificent , the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous , the oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning , and patrick doyle's score ( also oscar-nominated ) is sensitive and moving . oh yeah - the screenplay , by some guy named will s . , is not too bad either . film critics ribbed branagh for receiving the films' fourth oscar nod for ""adapting"" the screenplay , but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one . i cannot think of many better ways to make four hours fly by . nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly : the use of england's blenheim palace for exteriors , the edwardian dress , and the staging of ""to be or not to be"" in a hall of mirrors , to name a few . the casting of hollywood luminaries such as robin williams , billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting , but that is nitpicking . the principal cast excels : derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius; kate winslet acutely depicts ophelia's descent into madness; julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of gertrude; richard briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving polonius; and nicholas farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship . every speech , every line , every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there is not a wasted moment in the entire film . the final scenes magnify the extent of shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations . branagh's ""hamlet"" is a bold , ambitious , and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery . it's arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed strong praise , but well deserved .",1,10
"what's wrong with this film ? many , many things . the editing tries too hard to look good , and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him/her with a powerful headache . the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short ( story or film ) . the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story , and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film . we all know what happens to things when we stretch them , right ? exactly . they get thinner . in the end , the plot is just so paper-thin that you might even miss it , if you are not paying attention , which is hard to do when watching this movie . the acting is not even slightly impressive . the characters are poorly written and dull , uninteresting . one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently , whoever was in charge of the score/soundtrack had no idea what the movie was , or what it was supposed to be about ( not that i blame him , i could not figure it out either ) . as a result , half of the music in the film does not fit the scenes at all . also , what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character ? naturally , this was in order to attract young males , but it was just so cheaply done . and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film ? on any conceivable level ? at all ? the two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the film at all , they were just there in order to have some chase scenes . i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea . but i digress . i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who do not mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there is some sex and gore in it ( although that may only be true for the killer cut , which i saw ) . 1/10",0,1

"this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons . 1 ) perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking , but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android . 2 ) it was not an android at all , but a woman , the beautiful jean marsh . the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they would done it properly . in fact , the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as i speak . robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made , so they could have at least had her act like one . her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element . instead , it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star . the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity . normally no one cared . but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine , or downright carelessness .",0,4

"pretty good film from preminger; labyrinthine at times , as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live . in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying , as its hero , a good cop with a bad temper , gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head . dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet , and has never been better . the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight , and almost raises it to the level of tragedy . as his girl , gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable . gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain , with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews' coolness; his smiling , amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open , as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him . there are no major surprises in this film , which seems transitional for all concerned . for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars , andrews and tierney , who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made . the supporting cast , --merrill , karl malden , neville brand--are , understandably , more optimistic , as they were all on their way up . preminger , as serene an observer as ever , lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view , as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing , for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain , much less resolve .",1,8
"i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day . . . and i am surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie . basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message . . . well , mr-i'm-a-reviewer , it is an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge . not that i want to expose my life here , but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go . reject & ignorance on the menu . thing is . . . i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror . high schools have became battle fields of conformity . it's a real ugly sight . you need to fight your way into being like the others . it's hard to explain , bit a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence . meanwhile , parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect . the real motive of the movie is not about what is driving them . it's about this death-like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town . cal expressed it well . it's a wake up call . drama is everywhere and it can take every shape . in that case little dramas ( like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j . c penny shirt ) are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town . andre & cal took the most extreme way to express their pain . the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted . i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre & cal , like if with the pain they communicated , cal & andre have communicated their blind rage to their community , their refusal to think about the causes of some acts . it might seemed aggressive as a movie , but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating . what andre & cal are living is a reality . . . and a scary one that might get to other kids . disturbing movie . . . home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie .",1,9
"the ""wrinkle in time"" book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re-read them more times than i can count over the last 35+ years . the characters , with all their virtues and flaws , are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful , magical , spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement . if you have never read the book ( s ) i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable , the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie , and the story is interesting . however , if you love the books , avoid this movie at all costs . i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel : ""in an interview with newsweek , l'engle said of the film , 'i expected it to be bad , and it is .

"i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - maggie smith , a very young bob newhart and , of course , peter ustinov . my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film does not work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film . ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london . bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart , ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist' part of the film . to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe . and here is problem one . his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid . his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras . the second problem is the heist ( fraud really ) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension . maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinov's ditsy next door neighbor/secretary who just cannot keep a job . i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here , too composed , the part called for more of a wacky , physical comedian . furthermore , ustinov and smith have no chemistry together , maybe it is the age difference , but the later romantic relationship , as devoid of actual romance as it is , still comes off a little creepy . ustinov co-wrote the script , and it was thought well of at the time , but i found it unfunny , meandering and a sad waste of a great cast .",0,4
"this film is very creepy indeed . unfortunately , not for the reasons the film makers would hope . there's a mastermind serial killer too , but he is not what is creepy either . he's just your standard comic book villain , a cross between hannibal lecter and freddie kruger , though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either . incidentally , for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals , can they be detained chained in a stress position , on their feet , arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out ? i suppose in the world that gave us abu ghraib and guantanamo bay , anything's possible . no , what is really creepy about this film is the central character , danny . this unappealing young man , aided and abetted it is true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality , wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman , and on the basis of nothing whatsoever ( her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent ) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her . seemingly within days , he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her , believing ( completely falsely , as we discover ) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else , and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment , is sexually molesting her though she is ( again due to her sleepiness ) entirely unable to consent or resist . our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed . he is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships , let alone sexual relationships , so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman , who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years . the scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe-making , and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he will have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror . but again , i'm afraid , not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for , but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion . we can all see clearly what is on the end of our forks here - it is the paedophile's perfect dream of innocence , sexual compliance and utter dependence . horrible , horrible , horrible . what else have we got in this mish mash ? twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del toro . the compulsory ""you need to go to the police"" argument , where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it is the only sensible course of action . the automaton sequence , much praised in the comments here , though completely and utterly pointless ( ""it serves no function ! "" , as sigourney weaver memorably protested in galaxy quest ) and looking to me just like the abominable doctor phibes rehashed in one of the saw derivatives . jeffrey combs does his best though , so a star for that , and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this , and in general this is well-shot and competently performed .",0,3
"meryl streep was incredible in this film . she has an amazing knack for accents , and she shows incredible skill in this film overall . i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted . she was played realistically , too . she got cranky , upset , and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt . i did not expect much from the film initially , but i really got interested in it , and the movie is based on a real person and real events . it turned out to be better than i had anticipated . sam neill was also outstanding; this is the best work i've seen from him , and i've really liked him in other movies ( the piano , for example ) . i gave the film a 7 , but if i could rate just the acting , i'd give the it a 9 . 5 , and a perfect 10 for streep .",1,7
"man , what a scam this turned out to be ! not because it was not any good ( as i was not really expecting anything from it ) but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its ""stars"" as being stuart whitman , stella stevens and tony bill . sure enough , their names did not appear in the film's opening credits , much less themselves in the rest of it ! ! as it turned out , the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady ( 1975 ) but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody's guess even so , since i paid $1 . 50 for its rental and i was in a monster-movie mood anyhow , i elected to watch the movie regardless and , yup , it stunk ! apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew , an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws-like pretensions and , intentionally so , at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . the creature itself a plesiosaur i . e . half-dinosaur/half-fish is imperfectly realized ( naturally ) but , as had been the case with the giant claw ( 1957 ) which i've also just seen , this did not seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can , especially during the movie's second half !",0,1

"i approach films about talking animals with care . for every wonderful one like babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound : the incredible journey . or in the case of cats & dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . when i heard about paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot did not exactly fill me with confidence . but i found the film a pleasant surprise . and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising . a russian janitor , misha vilyenkov ( tony shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . one day , he hears singing coming from the basement . and when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . and not a few phrases either . its a parrot you can actually make conversation with . the parrot is called paulie ( voiced by jay mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in misha . wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story . which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . the two of them became birds of a feather ( ok , bad pun ! ) . when marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly . desperate to be reunited with her , paulie begins a long journey across america , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . of a cage that is ! paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s . and although it was not afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe , paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence . jay mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie . he never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart aleck . paulie's worldly , but he is also naive in his way . because he is lived a rather sheltered life with marie , when he is taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . and when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie , which he believes . only for those promises to be broken time and again . paulie is admittedly a little episodic . it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie . he first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by ivy ( gena rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . she sympathises with paulie's situation , and drives an rv across america to find marie . paulie is an occasionally very touching film . his scenes with ivy are some of the best . wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers . the way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking : ""there are things in life you put off , because you think you are gonna do them later . but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later . "" the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment . and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over . despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant . the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . and paulie even gets to have a romance . which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by mohr as well ) . that may be the only complaint i have . as soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves paulie on to another . the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . i'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . and paulie's diamond robbery is very mission impossible . he's caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he is remained ever since . the story finally comes full circle at the lab , where misha vows to help paulie . of course they do find marie . but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , i was left numb for several minutes . paulie may never get the longevity babe has , but i believe its an equally brilliant film . the same laughs . the same flawless effects . and the same surprising intelligence . a minor gem .",1,9

"hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr . sebastian caine ( kevin bacon ) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum . they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly , caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human . he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible , however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible . the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works , caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory . but then again he is invisible right , he can do anything he wants . . . directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man . you know it is just after christmas , i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick , not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief . the script by andrew w . marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise , it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man ( 1933 ) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit . it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror , sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes . i thought the character's were ok , i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it is generally known that verhoeven does not deal in subtlety , the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who is going to know' that caine says to himself . then of course there is the gore , he shows a rat being torn apart & that is just the opening scene after the credits , to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it . having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me , it is just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea . director verhoeven does a great job , or should that be the special effects boys make him look good . the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless , their brilliant & it is as simple & straight forward as that . there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top . i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins , organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla . there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten , someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results . with a staggering budget of about $95 , 000 , 000 hollow man is technically faultless , i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position would not they ? the acting was ok , bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy . hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film , well i know i do . good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product , definitely worth a watch .",1,7
"with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""they all laughed"" is very much a family affair . if you add the fact that b . gazzara and miss a . hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration . if this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent ""i love n . y . "" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn . make no mistake this is her picture . mr gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together . the plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance , it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie . mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors , from ""targets"" onwards . there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment . miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love . extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors , principally ""who the hell's in it ? "" , recently remaindered in uk bookstores . the soundtrack to ""they all laughed"" varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin , as eclectic as the city it portrays . mr b , s ""golden boy"" image was sure to tarnish , for such is the nature of the movie business , but it is equally sure one day to be restored , and when that day comes ""they all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is .",1,9
"there's a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist , actually exist right now . it's a bit too much to wrap your head around , but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place . for barbara jean trenton ( ida lupino ) , that time was twenty five years earlier , the mid 1930's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise . for my part , if i could travel through time , it would be back to the 1950's when i grew up . maybe to a place like willoughby , but that is another episode . one thing that would not be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of ""the twilight zone"" . how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series , and then find a particular story you wanted to watch ? i guess you have to consider the trade offs , convenience versus simplicity , having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins . popping in a cd has it is advantages . i'm a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled ""sunset boulevard"" . ida lupino's character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept . martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim , the husband turned butler who is loyalty is unquestioned . where the story diverges has to do with the way danny ( balsam ) and sall ( ted de corsia ) challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence . fortunately for us viewers , ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were 'not big , but a nice showcase' . it's a real treat to watch any episode of ""the twilight zone"" and get to see who pops up from days gone by . sometimes you get a two-fer , like you have here with lupino and balsam , celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began , and sometimes after . combined with the stories that the program produced , it is not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today .",1,7

"there were only two things that kept me interested in this film : i was waiting for owen wilson to die , and catherine zeta jones . this was basically a one woman show . catherine zeta jones was just there to provide eye-candy . liam neeson was totally wasted in this film . like jones , he had no role at all . the film was all lily taylor ( ransom , ready to wear ) . she was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by david self . ok , it was his first one and he did redeem himself with road to perdition . i do not know what director jan de bont's problem was . he did a great job with speed and twister . he really fell down on the job here . maybe he was still recovering from the disaster speed 2 : cruise control . he should thank his lucky stars for the wild wild west , else this would be the worst picture of 1999 . avoid at all costs .",0,4
"an american in paris was , in many ways , the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical . made at the height of mgm's powers as a musical powerhouse , the film features memorable music from the gershwins , who rightly have been called the 20th century's equivalent of beethoven and mozart . gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film , though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in singin' in the rain ( 1952 ) . the two films are actually closely linked . aside from the arthur freed connection , the broadway melody segment in ""rain"" owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film . this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film . and it deserved to be , as it showcases gene kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree . the film's cast is uniformly excellent . leslie caron , incredibly making her film debut , shows a maturity that makes you think she would been making films for years . her introductory dance sequence , and later her work on the ballet , provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in mgm musicals only by cyd charisse's work in singin' in the rain and the band wagon . oscar levant is hilarious as kelly's stoic pal , who gets two of the film's best moments : during the end party sequence ( which i will not give away for anyone who has not seen the film ) , and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art ( for the time ) special effects . less memorable are georges guetary as kelly's romantic rival , though he does get a few musical highlights , and nina foch as leslie caron's romantic rival . the may-december relationship between kelly's character and nina's reminded me of the same ""kept man"" relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffany's . there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin' in the rain . the ballet , though lavish and well-produced , does not really fit with the rest of the movie . without giving away the plot , the ballet just happens , with no real rhyme or reason . and unlike the broadway melody sequence , it really does not have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals , the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre . making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet . although the ending should not be a surprise ( this is an mgm musical , after all ) , i was hoping for a bit more . . . movie after the ballet ended . it's as if director vincente minnelli felt that he could not follow the ballet with anything else . the film literally left me in the lurch . that negative aside , an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywood's musicals . it does not quite reach the heights of singin' in the rain , but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time .",1,9
don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot . i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : death on the nile . everyone has done this one ! we know who dies . we know why they die . we know who the killer is . we know how it was done . so i say enough already ! mr . suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels . i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . the sets were terrific and very realistic . i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked . i hope he does not look that way in 'real' life ! i honestly cannot remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . somehow i do not think so . i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms . christie wrote it that way . i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison !,0,4
"** warning - contains spoilers ! ** first of all , i would like to say that i really liked this game . i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents . i am glad that i did that . first off , i would like to say that the single player was very good . the first level is probably one of the best in the game , when you are at a party in london , and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter . of course you have to rescue her , and it is quite a big level , but should probably take you at least five minutes . the best part , and i think also the funniest part , is when you are in the jet-pack , and people are rappelling down big ben . just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down . pure fun ! the rest of the levels are very good , but pretty short . there are four mini-levels you can unlock , and that is one of the let downs , because only the first two of them are actually fun , and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives , i mean , c'mon ! we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad ! the multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots . halo did not have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games ! you can be a load of bad guys , and you go against each other , and you can also set traps , which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character . gameplay - 8 . 5/10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ) . graphics - 9/10 ( there is the odd bad graphic , but that is not extremely often ) . multiplayer - 10/10 ( needs no comment , just great , you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles ) . sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 ( the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1 ) . i give this game : 8 . 5/10 could have a bit of improvement , but it is still good .",1,8
"i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s . i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad did not want to watch it . it became a weekly ritual every sunday , and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special . the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document . so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each . some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic . while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself . this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead . the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time . anthony eden the foreign secretary , carl donnitz , head of the u-boats , albert speer , pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler . in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge , hitler's secretary , who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines . these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed . if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers . the opening titles and music are magnificent , and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script . the best documentary series ever made ? without doubt . unmissable",1,10

' watch it and marvel .",1,10
"as i have matured , my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement . as in a few other comments that i have written , the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain . the omission of ""in cold blood"" in 1967 as one of the five best picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances , especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable ""dr . dolittle . "" while only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that rex harrison disaster , richard brook's powerful adaptation of truman capotes non-fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out . while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen , the film is definitely adult material . based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place , ""in cold blood"" was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white , and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio . together with quincy jones's unsettling score , hall's work should have been credited above the title with brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built . the performances are fine as well . scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense introversion as the two killers . ( there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and ""the treasure of the sierra madre"" while the duo are driving to mexico . as a child star , blake sold the lottery ticket to bogart in that john huston film . ) the film , like the book , is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti-capital punishment tilt , although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult-to-watch final scenes . some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals , their backgrounds , and lives , while the clutter family , which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night , come across as one-dimensional characters of little import . this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row . the clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth . however , whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment , ""in cold blood"" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts . run a double bill with ""dead man walking , "" and you may not speak for days .",1,10

"*may contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers* in the age of shrek ( the movie ) & pixar ( the studio ) , this is a much more traditional animation film . it put together some characters that normally would not be seen together ( not to mentioned , try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father ) . they begin as enemies and end as best friend . if this sound like a disney film , it is ( only made through 20th century fox ) . the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages , but the movie does not live to the expectation the trailer set . the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film did not made up their mind who is the target audience of the film . yes , there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children . the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min . their children's attention is focused on something else than them . the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film . children will love this film , adults will only like it .",1,7
"first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great , the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done . it's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment , ******** spoilers below ******** from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-american , normally this sort of stereotyping would not bother me ( we brits get enough from hollywood ) but here it is not subtle about making the americans brain-dead morons . it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors mother . the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill . here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death , then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying . hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis ! the whole virus sideline is ridiculous . if the americans know there is not a virus , why are they wasting time , money and resources investigating ? the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing , making the americans look evil ( or stupid ) , it was not helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect . the movie is about hunting the monster . us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible . the only people hunting the monster , in the whole of korea , is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day ! naturally a few us/korean agents try to stop them along the way . the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end . it was clich d , you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part ! and my final annoyance , how the hell did that kid survive at the end ? the monster had been swimming with it is head underwater for about 5 minutes ! why did not the monster eat the kids in the first place ?",0,2

"well ! what can one say ? firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all . after seeing sean connery's interpretation of the great man in ""the league of extraordinary gentlemen"" , swayzee really does not make the grade . this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . for example . when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment . in some ways i wish he had . the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to london , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play . 4 out of 10 . barely",0,4
"i bought a set of 4 dvds for 10 bucks at my local suncoast , which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks ( including its sequel ""witchcraft xi"" ) . so basically i paid the rock bottom price of $2 . 50 for this movie , if you do the math . i cannot exactly say i was ripped off . i have a thing for trashy horror movies , but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name . the budget could not be over $1 , 000 ( though it appears as if they spent a total of $1 . 50 ) . i know it is a low-budget film , but that is no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork . the film ""blood cult , "" though not very good , was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting . the acting in this movie is the definition of ""effortless , "" especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent . everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page . you can take that figuratively or literally . i would not be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing . i said before that i've never seen a bad english actor . this movie has quite a few bad ones . and though english movies are not always good , they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication , which is why i do not see why any englishman , or englishwoman , would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this . did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls ? usually , i think people are too hard on directors and actors . even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing , acting and cinematography departments . even when you watch a movie like ""glitter"" you cannot honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes ( though a third-grader could have written the script ) . i've seen home movies that are shot better than ""witchcraft x , "" and that is no exaggeration whatsoever . even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city . not a single effort was put into making this movie--let us just sum it up like that . you get the picture . there's a good deal of nudity , though that does not save it . however , i must say that girl with the red-orange hair , who is either naked or wearing a cleavage-popping outfit throughout the film , is really hot ! my score : 1 ( out of 10 )",0,1

"i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy . no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm , but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle . let's face it , she looks good , she is light years hotter than my mother who is the same age ! it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first , but ever since the turn of the century that is all movie goers seem to expect : a cinematic experience that will touch your soul . as such , it never claims to be either . it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling , and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate . it's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel . fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen . the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure . the score is amazing as well . sure there is some overacting from some characters but there is some brilliant work from david morrissey who is virtually unknown . there's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop . as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for . at the very least it is entertaining and fun to look at it , and that is the movie's only intentions . so if you have got beef with mizz stone , maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit ?",1,8
"you could stage a version of charles dickens' ""a christmas carol"" with sock puppets and i'll probably watch it . ever since i was a child , this has been one of my favorite stories . maybe it is the idea that there is good in everyone , and that therefore no one is beyond redemption , that appeals to me , but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they are on tv as they inevitably are this time of year . what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles . lines we have heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity , and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble . george c . scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role . it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft-portrayed role of scrooge , he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was , in my opinion , one of his finest performances ever . he wisely did not attempt a british accent , instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice . his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man ( as he is so often portrayed ) , but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world . as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits , we understand how this anger took root , grew , and ultimately strangled his soul . as he is forced to review his life , we see him alternately softening , and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy . and in the great dramatic scene when he , kneeling and weeping at his own grave , begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life , we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively . scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human . impressive as scott's performance is , the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty . fred holywell , scrooge's nephew , is an excellent example of this . often portrayed as an affable buffoon , here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals . when he implores scrooge , ""i ask nothing of you . i want nothing from you . why cannot we be friends ? "" , we see in his face not only his frustration , but his pain at scrooge's self-imposed separation from his only living relative . it is a moving performance , and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes . even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge's late partner , jacob marley . in most versions of this tale , the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film , simply because it is difficult to portray a dead man convincingly , and the results are usually just plain silly ( ooooh , look , it is a scary ghost . . . . . . . not ! ) in this version , it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie . marley's entrance , as the locks on scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house , is wonderfully creepy . but finlay's marley is no ethereal spirit . he is a tortured soul , inspiring both horror and pity . marley may be a ghost , but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth , and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress , are still very human . as portrayed by finlay , we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition . finlay really steals the scene here , something not easy to do when you are opposite george c . scott . and it just goes on and on , one remarkable performance after another , making it seem like you are experiencing this story for the first time . edward woodward ( remember him from the equalizer ? ) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present . when he delivers the famous line , ""it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child"" he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate , but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spanking . susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs . cratchit , and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit , a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty , a sick child , and an insufferable boss . his face alternately shows his cheerful courage , and also , at times , his weariness , in the face of intolerable circumstances . later , in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim , warner's performance , while hardly uttering a word , will move you to tears .",1,10
"this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood . the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business . the idea that audiences paid to see this movie ( and like an idiot i rented the film ) is discouraging also . obsessed teacher ( 3 years prior ) kills teenager's family because he wants her . for no reason he kills the mother , father and brother . from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction . years later , obsessed teacher breaks out of prison . hmm--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute . obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around , sniff out people and with a knife is super killer . sure ! ! ! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason , knifes bellhop for the fun of it , and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends . now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you . obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid , ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them . now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend . there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage . if any other profession put out work of this low quality , they would be fired . yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash .",0,1

"different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts . as a result , we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned . jafar panahi , unlike j . l . godard or f . truffault , believes in simple story telling; schematic narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job . he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer; he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers . he is equally effective despite being conventional . offside ( 2006 ) , is another schematic creation from him , where gender subordination of middle-east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses . now-a-days , when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women , this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the egality of human rights is nothing but an illusive good , an utopia . paternity will never let the women to be empowered . an important soccer match where the nation is participating , a teenage girl who understands the game well , loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country . she is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary . her alias could not work for her . as a result , she had to undergo several humiliating situations . from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter . at the end of the day , celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time . but the celebration cannot suppress the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format . jafar panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well . a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which , in turn , teases our being constantly .",1,9

"even thought i'm not the biggest of cher fans , this movie was her crowning achievement . granted , there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage , memory loss ( and ) intellectual impairment , upon the screening such a film . a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one-third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds . cher plays someone very un-cher in this movie , a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family . they're anti-american , pro-italian and always at each other in someway . she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while , a nice mamma's boy man , and he asks her to marry him . she says yes . i loved her mom's questions : ""do you love him loretta ? "" , ""no . "" , ""good . if you love him he will drive you crazy because they know they can . but you like him then ? "" , ""oh yeah , he is a sweet man ma"" . when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother , he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he is been estranged from for years . this victory for human rights carries even greater significance , as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment . in 1938 , italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti , saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs , easing the job of slitting their throats . cerletti was inspired , and began experimenting with electroshock on humans , developing the first electroshock machine . broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern . this was , in so many ways , an anti-american movie . it's about love , to be sure , but it is also about infidelity , secrets , lonely people , and strange behavior brought on by american policies . the characters , from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant , the aunt and uncle , her parents and their problems , the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters . it's somewhat of a chick flick , as it is how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp . it's a cinderella story in many ways , and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan . . . assuming free and fully informed consent , it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses . but we might ask ourselves whether we , as fans of cinema , though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath , should be offering it .",0,4
"i was really surprised with this movie . going in to the sneak preview , knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen , i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest . i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that is just how movies work . instead i got a smart , surprisingly original movie about a decent , average guy who just never had sex . yes , the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple ! , but it is done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys . all the characters are people you probably know in real life , redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives . i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap , and i was very surprised . yea , it is pretty over the top ( c'mon , it is a movie about a 40 year old virgin ! ) , but it is very smartly done . in the end , you are really pulling for this guy to get laid , which says a lot about the movie because honestly , did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not ?",1,10
"gandhi , the great : greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great , ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans . gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human , for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies . gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies . let me move to the movie review now . about gandhi my father : gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi . on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth , the director succeeds in portraying the tale . the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness . the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi's failure as a father to his son , i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation . i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india , the gandhian land , but through the hearts of all the people of this world . gandhi the true human . jaihind .",1,10
"this film deserves another bad review . consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex , violence or gore . ' uh , excuse me . the very set-up of the film has us watching as cody's young comrade , with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless , bloody body . and , given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis . so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines cody's persona is erased from viewer memory . sans any family of his own cody , like john rambo , roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city . no mention , no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods . we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war . this explains , as none seem to notice or care , cody's obvious 'flat' effect . it is not bad acting . it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder . not guessing here , remember his co ordered him off the battle field . how about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review . the fall was an accident , the kiss was not . how exactly was cody 'respecting' faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for ? now that was a non-family value moment . a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube . of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season , all cheering their cheaten' hearts and lips . we know little about faith's fianc except that she professes her love for him , she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal ( could have waited if any second thoughts ) , he is generous , he loves her to death , the family has nothing really against him , he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans . no evil doers here . asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son . . . . ' 'you are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named cody . and the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field . bottom line : this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways . most grossly when it applauds cody's disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for . by re-defining family as we know it to wit : accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you .

"when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 ( zombie flesheaters 2 in europe ) on an import region 2 japanese dvd , i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is . the transfer is just about immaculate , as good as it is ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it . the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx . the sound is also terrific . it's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 , you can really appreciate the cheesy music ( actually a very good score ) , and the effective although cheap sound effects . it never sounded so good , and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment . i never realized just how much blood flows in this film , it is extremely brutal with exploding head shots , exploding puss filled mega pimples , a cleaver to a zombies throat , a woman's burned off extremities ( how come it did'nt burn the guy also ) , intestinal munching , zombie babies and so much more i lost track . this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans , especially of the italian kind . there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found , i think people do not give it enough credit , if you see a clean print , and not some horrendous pirate copy , it is a whole other experience entirely . this film never lets up for a second , and i realize it is inconsistent plotwise , the dubbing is horrible , the acting is stiff , and it is sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion , but that is part of it is charm . to me this is one of the best horror films ever made , you cannot make a film this bad , so good , on purpose . it's accidental genius of the highest order . if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster , but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it is nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards . tons of action sequences , exotic locales , excellent set design , good , sometimes great cinematography , wonderfully cheesy acting , and inconsistent but still interesting plot , great makeup effects , beautiful women who can kick butt , excellent music , and sometimes hilarious , sometimes creepy , but always entertaining zombies . how can you go wrong with this film , it has it all , a cult classic that stands the test of time .",0,4

"i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier's films . i consider 'breaking the waves' nothing less than a masterpiece . i loved 'dancer in the night' . i admired the idea in 'dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical , less cinema . 'europa' which i see only now was a famous film at its time , succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie , but did not survive well the time in my opinion . it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste . the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer . treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished , of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today , more such was novel and courageous two decades ago . yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task . the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock , especially his early films set in the pre-war europe , with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark . the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism . here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re-birth of germany after war , of its might , of its obsession with order and regulation , of punctuality and civility . the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys . the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post-war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption , with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers , with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self-destruction , with love doubtfully mixed with treason . it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case . the actions of the characters , especially of leopold kessler played by jean-marc barr seem confused , and lack credibility . the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock-like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s . the usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative . it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means , but he is too demonstrative , he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is . he really is great , as he will show in some of his later films , but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone .",0,4

"oh dear we do not like it when our super-hero love interest develops a brain do we ? something has happened to people , they have lost the ability to enjoy , a simple feel-good , love story/comedy ? kirsten dunst is a revelation - funny , sexy and real . i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too . the cast , acting and script is great , i watch a lot of films right across the board and i have not seen one in this genre that has been as successful . those who disagree please tell me where i can find some ! i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits .",1,8

"i once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck , such as rambo 3 , baise moi , deep impact ) - but mr . seidl almost succeeded . hundstage was a truly awful experience . anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable , pathetic bunch of retards . it shows a world where love and humanity do not exist , a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence . by choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock-cartoonist deix ) director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian ( european ? western ? ) suburbs . the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies , violence against women and handicapped people , madness and degradation . but this is not social criticism . this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value . instead you get bad acting , bad cinematography , bad filmmaking . if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes . this is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer . and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way . it shows ugly people - that is not the reason why i hate it . but it depicts average people in an ugly , misanthropic way . and this is why this film is truly despicable .",0,1
"when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it could not fail . i love billy crystal , my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it . we were misled , in spades . on my part , i felt billy crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film . sure , he cracked a couple of good jokes , but as a character he did nothing but take up space . and poor julia roberts . in past shows she plays well as a strong-willed , self-determined lady . in this flick , she seems completely repressed and had very little fire . this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching . ok , if i were to find one good thing , it would have to be christopher walken . now that is entertainment . but , just like billy crystal , hardly anything is shown of his character . if you are looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value , go see it . but if you are looking for a smart , romantic comedy , this is not your film . it's none of the above .",0,4
"well the previews looked funny and i usually do not go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because . . . . . . well you never know . here is a movie that does not appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults . i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h * t spells . essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr . seuss's classic . it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money . if that was a subplot , then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and ""the cat"" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is . take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie .",0,1
"we have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies . hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies , noir , two reel oaters , etc to movies with a message . we had blackboard jungle , on the waterfront and so on . some folks might think that was an improvement . i do not . who was the mogul who said : if you want to send a message , call western union ? he was right . these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy . this one is a pip . it's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's estate . one of them , maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay . he's initially in it for the bucks , but eventually falls for her . meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance . the results are predictable . you get a little bit of everything in this movie . sexual tension between the sisters . a little subtle masochism . hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing . we never get to meet the parents , but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown . one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar . the acting is so bad it is hard to believe . it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel-air productions . it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits . the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke . it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene . i cannot explain it - not even to myself - but i gave this pile of trash an 8/10 . i'm familiar with the term ""it's so bad it is good"" , but i do not think i ever ran into the phenomenon before . well , maybe ""hot rods to hell"" , but this one certainly fits . you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody's basement .",1,8

"the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked . late night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that . when we do get to a point , it is so monumentally moronic that i kept thinking i must have misunderstood it . but i did not . sean tells the story of an osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so did not realise they were sharing . his friend asks ""but what about the weekends ? "" sean does not have an adequate explanation . sean then tells the story of his own similar problem , which is that he is not sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other . this has been going on for three weeks . but his friend does not ask : ""yes , but as i said before , what about the weekends ? you must see her then . it does not make sense . what are you going on about , sean ? are you on medication or something ? "" but let us be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week . we see sean checking to see if the soap and towels have been used . ( in fact , bizarrely , he starts to carry the soap around with him . ) but what about his girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo , sanpro and moisturiser , toothpaste and toothbrush . let's go to the kitchen . what about food and drink ? is any missing ? has any been bought ? in the bedroom , has the shared bed been made or not ? are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones ? is the laundry basket fuller ? in the toilet , is the seat up or down ? i mean , good grief ! and to cap it all paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home . why does not he just phone her ? but it gets worse . in the last act although no-one told vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them . lenny's love interest and sean's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group . there is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences . to be fair the dialogue is ok but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame story . i heard one of actors interviewed and he promised ""no guns , no drugs , no corsets . "" i thought , ""great"" . but after half-an-hour of tedium i was yelling at the screen : ""i want guns ! i want drugs ! i want corsets !

"i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie , romantic interest or damsel in danger . but , everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l . a . confidential , and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance . however , after that moment , her career did not follow the ideal path . sure , the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies ( like people i know or the door in the floor ) , but we have never seen her again on a substantial character . the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty , but also that the movie is really crappy . the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic . however , basinger brings some conviction to her character , and that makes this poor movie to win a few points . this movie is full of clich s and generic villains . the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly , because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone . the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous . i do not recommend while she was out at all . this film commits the capital sin of being boring .",0,4
its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book . this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails . it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one ( except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films ) . the only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v .,0,3

"it was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined; however , there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good ( or rather : bad ) as pearl harbor . it is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces , but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world . i'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great ( youssef chahine's , for example , has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamura's has a really bizarre ending ) or that the segments are in the right order ( imamura's , being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers , should open the film , not end it , alejandro gonzales inarritu's should be the last one instead , as it is the most impressive one ) . but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers . consider samira makhmalbaf's opening segment , in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence . or idrissa ouedraogo's part ( which features a bin laden-double so much resembling the real one that you will be shocked when you see him , i promise ) , in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden . there's a surprisingly good ( and extremely angry ) segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls ""our tuesday september 11"" - that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia . this could have become a terrible effort in anti-americanism , but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritu's ( mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen , sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower , ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing ) and amos gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv ( hard to recognize , but this one is a masterpiece of choreography ) . all these different segments ( i have not mentioned yet claude lelouch's about a deaf girl , danis tanovic's about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica , mira nair's - strange , but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes - about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and sean penn's with ernest borgnine ( yes , ernest borgnine ) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine ) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget . i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now . i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies . but , alas , it is far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort . and as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that do not reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience .",1,10

"hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 . i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess , but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film . in this film , the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 . he is famous for a game he played against steinitz , where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz . instead of resigning , he simply walked out of the tournament hall , never to return . the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments . chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice , and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life . a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer . although a genius , he was also very disturbed in many ways . in the film , a world championship match is depicted , as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin . the format is a knockout , which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final . but this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format , where the winners of each group play against each other . the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself . in fact , i have done a youtube video about it , for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy ! http : //uk . youtube . com/watch ? v=xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon",1,10
"""handsome guys with bad haircuts ! ! "" ""beautiful girls without any clues ! ! "" ""stupid gangsters who cannot shoot straight ! !

""welcome to the party , pal .

"watching john cassavetes film , opening night , i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting . he referred to an example of , say , if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would not be the end of his life but that it would affect him , and that , without a doubt , he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy . ""otherwise , "" as he said , ""what am i doing ? "" i could not help but think of his words when watching gena rowland's character , myrtle gordon , who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario . there is more to this in cassavetes' film , of course , since it is about how the theater works around a star actress , what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character , and how one lives when all one has ( like myrtle gordon ) is the theater . near the beginning of the film , after exiting a performance , myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle . it's a touching little moment , but it does not last as she has to get in the car ( pouring rain and all ) . she then watches in horror as the girl , who stood right next to the car as it drove off , gets hit by another car in an auto accident . she is not sure really what happened , but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit . from then on she is sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it is out of her system . at first this shows in small ways , like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor ( played by cassavetes ) and cannot seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character ( the writer : ""what do you think the play lacks ? "" ""hope , "" says myrtle ) - but then nancy starts to show up to her , an apparition that to myrtle is all to real , until she is suddenly gone . cassavetes , as in the past films , is after a search for what it means to have emotion , to really feel about something and feel it , or the lack thereof , and how it affects others around the person . this is not exactly new ground for rowlands , who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence ( in that case because of alcohol ) , nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara , who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie . but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; cassavetes does not tell them how to get from a to b in a scene , and he does not need to . there's a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work . you know myrtle , for example , should be content somehow , even if it is not with the plot . but she is haunted , and is unsatisfied with her character's lack of depth and the tone of the play ( ""aging , who goes to see that ? "" she asks the playwright ) , and it starts to affect those around her too . the question soon becomes though not what is the usual . a conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'will she be able to go on stage , will the show go on ? ' this is not important for cassavetes , even if it is there , as is the question 'will she be alright ? ' perhaps going through such a grueling play as ""the second woman"" could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality ( seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers , who wonder what the hell is going on ) ? or will the play's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her ? the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing , and that it is expected does not mean it is any duller than woman under the influence- if anything , it is just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession , and consequently the other performances are just as true , from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson . cassavetes answers to his own posed questions are not easy . one of the real thrills of opening night , along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script , is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does . we see the play performed- and it is apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it is about . when we see the actors on the stage performing it , we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on ( relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence ) and the improvisation of the actors . i wondered watching how much really was improvised , how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or , in the climax , is completely smashed . he's on the stage , too , so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen . it's funny , startling , chilling , and edge-of-your-seat stuff , some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie , and we see the lines between actor on stage , actor on film , actor with actor , blur together wonderfully . opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness , reality and fiction , where the love is between people , and really , finally , what does 'acting' mean ?",1,10
"okay . yes , this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors ( like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together ) , and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part , and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad ( plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles ) . but come on . richard grieco was hysterical ( his hair alone is worth the trip ) . steven ford was very likable . mancuso had some great lines , while nancy allen , ironically , was completely bland and uninteresting . classic ? no . bad parts ? yes . entertaining ? big yes . i would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have .

"titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship . writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 , 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic . the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet . they make for a good on-screen couple . dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable . they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well . the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane , kathy bates , frances fisher , jonathan hyde , and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film . the love story , the action , suspense , and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time . the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation . the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it is few flaws . titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it . the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg . overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .",1,8

"written by stephen king , but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film . a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret . they are sleepwalkers , feline type creatures that feed on young virgins . this little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest . alice krige is outstanding as the mother . others appearing are madchen amick , brian krause and cindy pickett . look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker . stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery .",0,4
"tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971 . at this point , america knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana . the film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character roland boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold . i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general . . great acting , and very memorable . also the directors use of film and style works so well , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam . its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell . . . and it is futility . fantastic film . not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army' . rating 9 out of 10 .",1,9
"don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago , ""the sarah silverman"" is wonderfully bizarre , surreal , immature , ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line-up . if silverman tones down the juvenile ""doody"" jokes and emphasizes the darker , meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at , we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled ""strangers with candy"" . but just from watching the pilot , its just solid , not outstanding , offbeat dark comedy/musical but with huge potential . silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier , younger , jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional , non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television . early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i cannot wait to see how this show unfolds .",1,7
"i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot . after many subsequent viewings ( and purchase of the video ) it still makes me laugh out loud . yes , it is a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america - but well executed is well executed . but it is also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism , the baby boom and the nascent consumer age . this film is no ""guilty"" pleasure . three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane melvyn douglas; bemused cary grant; daffily determined myrna loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters . my favourite scenes - ""it means we gotta blast"" and ""miss stellwaggen"" and ""this little piggy"" . love it .",1,9
"once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who tvm . as soon as it was announced that the doctor`s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed "" who is eric roberts ? "" . i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham , the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school . actually looking back now roberts is best known for the pope of greenwich village and runaway train but that didn`t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who tvm a great many fans ( myself among them ) thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production yeah i`m digressing but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i`d heard the name of eric roberts but i didn`t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it . i know nothing about fencing ( everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . i don`t fence ) so i don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max suba and alexander villard being off centre for most of the film but i wasn`t convinced about their love/hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword",0,4
"i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg's appearance ( a passionate fetish of theirs ) on the cover . understandably , i did not expect much . i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in clich rap videos . however , my generalization was for the most part wrong . unfortunately , this did not make the movie any better . most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama , whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick . the film tells a story of two struggling writers ( dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg ) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces . their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship . this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder . and although the movie is a drama , the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from snoop and company was more comical than anything else . i would not recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that . there are some mediocre conflicts , but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue . the end , however , jumped at me with a sudden surprise . it was a little bit twisted , somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end . while watching the ending credits i could not help but picture the director thinking , ""oh god , how the hell do i end this snoozer . "" by the way , the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters .",0,4
"in 1692 salem , a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar . costume drama starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray is not stuffy , though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria . worked on by three writers ( walter ferris , durward grimstead , and bradley king ) , the story elements are rather interesting ( especially coming out of hollywood in 1937 ) , though to anyone who has since read arthur miller's ""the crucible"" , the hoked-up melodrama on display here will not be tolerated for very long . biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting : colbert and macmurray are an ill-matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch-hunt , macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings . *1/2 from ****",0,3
"the head of a common new york family , jane gail ( as mary barton ) , works with her younger sister ethel grandin ( as loma barton ) at ""smyrner's candy store"" . after ms . grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves , ms . gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore ( as larry burke ) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman . ""traffic in souls"" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not remarkably well done , and it does not show anything very unique in having a young woman's ""virtue"" threatened by sex traders . perhaps , it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length ( claimed to have been ten reels , originally ) . the new york city location scenes are the main attraction , after all these years . the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable , because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move . **** traffic in souls ( 11/24/13 ) george loane tucker ~ jane gail , matt moore , ethel grandin",0,4
"a horribly pointless and , worse , boring film . stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything , no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes , and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way . will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey's truman show , and substitutes his usual shouting routine ( admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights ) for , well , pretty much nothing . emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating ( that some reviews i've read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable ) whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . please . that she ended up falling for ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous . marc forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with . i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this . i wish i'd opted for the prestige .",0,2
"two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows; veer zaara and deewaar . although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone , deewaar focuses on the main subject itself . it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years - for whom neither indian govt . has time or sympathy nor the other side . i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well , but let us focus on the movie . full of actors . some were stage actors like raghubir yadav , rajendra gupta , etc . amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major , acted well . akshaye khanna did his part well . there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs . i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it was not too long . he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive . if you compare it to loc , which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions ( if it had a story ) - deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors . 7 . 5/10",1,7

"well , i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie . despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy , and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason , i was not disappointed . the story was actually pretty interesting : the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil , and who is using them for good . the catch being that during training , all of the clan were masked , and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names . the fights are a joy to watch , as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style : toad ( my favorite ) , snake , scorpion , lizard , and centipede . the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place , and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action . the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence . but stick with it , and you will not be disappointed !",1,7

"'umi wa miteita' ( 'the sea is watching' ) was akira kurasawa's swansong to film : his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career . director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image . set in 19th century japan , the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men . the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers . each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha . oshin ( nagiko tono ) supports her family who live in a neighboring village , kikuno ( misa shimizu ) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste . oshin befriends an endangered samurai , falls in love with the gentle fellow , only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed . oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically/monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas . a handsome samurai ryosuke ( masatoshi nagase ) enters oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her . kikuno is beset by problems , deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her , and coping with a rich but abusive customer . all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street , oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke . the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice , love , and devotion . the sea is watching and will find protection for true love . the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful : night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent . the acting is a bit strained for edo art , but the characters are well created and keep the story credible . the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track . but in the end there is enough of kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema . grady harp",1,8

'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around . a showcase of great scenes and stunts . one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie , and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning , it maintains its action awesomeness . john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining , and one bad dude . quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever .

"this movie is just a lot of fun . i've seen it a couple of times , but it always has something funny that i remember . the ""duckies and bunnies"" car scene is one of my favorites , and i still quote morone's versions of certain words ! there are so many running jokes , that it is amazing . but i love michael keaton anyhow !",1,8
"things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world , or ""everytown"" through 100 years . you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts . the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the ""boss"" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again , after everytown was bombed and war broke out . this film only has about 3 faults : it is audio is muddy and video had some quirks , the characters are not deep at all , and the overall plot is not altogether solid . the plot is lacking something that i cannot put my finger on . . . it just seems a little ""fluffy . "" but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h . g . wells though might happened in the next hundred years , this is a must see . it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing : a long , drawn-out war , because they were just about to go to war with germany , and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything . things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once .",1,7
"i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much . it seems that disney , however , is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-dvd sequels . they deserve a razzie . several , in fact . i thought the idea had merit , but the music was absolutely awful and the story was not much better . what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films . mary poppins , aladdin , beauty and the beast , the lion king . . . even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame . they've made so many great movies over the years that it is really sad that they have sunk to point of making sequels that are not even good enough to put in theatres . i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation .",0,4
"well , i have finally caught up with ""rock 'n' roll high school , "" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 . ( latecomer that i am , i will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""patti smith : dream of life"" sometime around 2040 ! ) and no , the film does not feel dated one bit , and yes , it was worth the wait . this is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments . it tells the story of riff randell , adorably played by p . j . soles , and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal , miss togar . ( danny peary , in his book ""cult movies , "" quite accurately describes mary woronov's performance as an ""evil eve arden . "" ) a typical teens vs . establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor ( those exploding mice , that giant mouse , the hansel and gretel hall monitors ) and some truly rousing tunes . riff is , of course , the #1 fan of that original punk band the ramones , and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film , including five at a concert that is a total blast . indeed , the sight of riff furiously dancing to ""teenage lobotomy"" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment . and the initial appearance of joey , johnny , dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile , and later slinking down a street singing ""i just wanna have something to do , "" is quite exhilarating . the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is , i would imagine , every high school kid's wet dream . fun stuff indeed . on a side note , the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert , so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired . how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary , i wonder . . . .",1,7
"a sweet and totally charming film , shall we dansu ? made me laugh and cry . at first appearance , sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing--an uptight salaryman , seemingly devoted to his family , but all too easily captivated by a face in a window . the object of his obsession is distant and cold . but by the end of the movie , i was in love with him , her , his wife and daughter , all the dance instructors and dance students . this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again .",1,8
"it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any ""gray matters"" will agree that this movie just does not work . the problems lay in the direction , cast selections and lack of depth in the character building . the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used . let's look at the problems in direction/script . brother and sister both in their mid 30's seem to be well adjusted . they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer . he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him . then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week's time ? ? ? ? hello does anyone feel stupid yet ? he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her . not only was there no chemistry it just does not make sense . sure it is a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could , but the direction made it completely flat . now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan ( very shallow character ) kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there . i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role . this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew . it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction .",0,1
"tainted look at kibbutz life this film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz , but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general . in the first two minutes of the movie , the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves . and it is all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical ""kibbutznikim . "" besides the two main characters , a clinically depressed woman and her young son , every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil . the story centers on how the kibbutz , like some sort of cult , slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows . there is no happiness , no joy , no laughter in this kibbutz . every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny , hypocrisy , violence , cultism , repression etc . for example , while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his ""jewish"" physical appearance and brutish personality . he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother . he treats these volunteers like trash . after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he has not seen in a long time due to his military service , he orders , quote ""linda , go take shower and i cum in two minutes . "" there is one other ""good"" character in this movie a european foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend . when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son , the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm . he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for ""violent"" behavior against one of the kibbutz members . more hypocrisy : the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 , or without love and gives an account of the actual act that is supposed to be humorous for the audience , but is really just stupid . she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse . the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult . children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders . the mother apparently cannot ""escape"" the kibbutz , although in reality , anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose . it's a mystery how the boy's father died , but you can rest assured , the kibbutz ""drove him to it"" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless , wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son . that's the gist of this movie . one dimensional characters , over dramatization , dry performances , and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head that kibbutz life was degrading , miserable and even deadly for those who did not ""fit in . "" i feel sorry for the guy who made this film obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz . but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs .",0,1

"this could be looked at in many different ways . this movie sucks , its good or its just plain weird . the third one probably explains this movie best . it has strange themes and just has a strange plot . so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad , average or even how good it might be . the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller . jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad . christopher walken is always off the wall . he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is . comedy wise it is somewhat funny . this of course meaning that it does have its moments ( though very few ) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way . the directing was average as well . barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here . this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it . just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film . the writing is the key to a good comedy . obviously that means the writing here failed . at best it is below average . considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible . that is never a good thing to say about a movie though . if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating . he is always quite a character in his movies . stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really do not go anywhere . not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie .",0,4
"let's be honest . as a film school project , made without budget and ""real"" actors , this is a passably interesting film . as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer , it is a very poorly produced product . if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally , it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while . as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product , i . e . a film , i feel deeply disappointed . it's a videotaped tv play , something along the line of old sixties serials , but without that certain charm . aside from the leading man mr redfield ( who also is the director ) , the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus ( a bit too old for that actually ) , or members of the director's household , who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches , but also the make-up artist or hairdresser ( a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s ) . it's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small , bare studio , sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds . synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame ""period"" inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion . the film attempts to be ""dreamlike"" , whereas in fact it is merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing ( and believe me , the standards were not too high to start with ) . there are interesting dialogs every now and then , but overall it is pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew . that's how ""artsy"" films attempted to look in the 80s . mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director .",0,2
"i do not want to go too far into detail , because i cannot really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film , but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating . the humor was completely lost on the audience , and yes - ghost in the shell fans , this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy , and the humor just did not work after being translated . it was a total chore to watch this movie , and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest , especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything - i was not expecting a ghost in the shell sequel , but i was expecting something entertaining , and it simply did not achieve this . yaaawwnnn . . . rent kino's journey instead .",0,3
"talk about a blast opening , ""trampa infernal"" has the coolest opening credits ever ! guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary ""friday the 13th"" theme ( tsh-tsh-tsh-ha-ha-ha ) , the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables . promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes . two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar . according to a newspaper article , there is a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it . the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls . upon arrival , however , it quickly becomes obvious they are not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve . after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers , this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid . the formula is simplistic but efficient , the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful . the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers , as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face . the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric , which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences , and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood . the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular . ""trampa internal"" is a mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre .",1,7

"first , nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly . not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard-boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ( ghost trains ) as a child . second , the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future . third , this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes , eva mendezes , and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb-lights are . mrs . christian is not a light , but a sun . however , ""dark remains"" is also of considerable metaphysical importance . they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and ""imagination"" that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new . but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times . this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality ( by which reality turns into a sign ) , but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the ""real"" reality can . being a sign , the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects , i . e . the sign behaves like an object . now , in our usual world of perception , it is common that objects change signs . f . ex . , if someone grows a bird , his photograph will show him with beard , not without , as it did before . but the opposite , the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man . this is , very simply expressed , the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison , in this movie . this is new , and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well-known , mostly since the silent time .",1,10

"this is one of those film's/pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps , but is not necessary . what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this is not something so far away in the future . this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically . the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors . eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he will do it no matter the cost . paula malcomson of ""deadwood"" fame is terrific as his wife as well . you are not sure completely of his motives whether it is love or money or both , but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing . i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani & her performance . esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections . i did not think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story . it's great to see adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage . i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots . this is an almost perfect pilot & i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling . even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen . if you have not gotten into bsg , @ least try this & i'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the bsg story came to be .",1,8

"i did not even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min . of that movie again i think i'm going to shoot myself . . . and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i was not surprised at all i mean who did not know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that . i know i did not miss anything and if somebody ask's me to see that movie i would say ""over my dead body"" .",0,1
"at last ! a decent british comedy that is not centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series . john ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery , dressed in biker gear . the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives , giving a sensitive , emotional trio of sub-plots to sew the riotous comedy together . the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments . it feels part withnail and i , part american werewolf in london , and part quadraphenia ( but only because of the bike gangs , and phil daniels ) . in fact , phil daniels' lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i , with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs . this is a great film , particularly for those who have dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past , who will relate to many moments in the film . a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop , buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms . this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud . and you do not have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it . but it will add to it if you do . brilliant .",1,10
"_les acteurs_ is the absurd story of jean-pierre marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water , the story of a conspiracy against actors , the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be , but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema . supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting ( the fourth wall , the hidden cameras , to play or not to play ) , the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role ( not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur ) is quite vague , and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing . as andr dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part ( great actress , she is hilariously serious especially when , in dussolier's role , she bitches about herself ) , as actors run in each other on the street , asking for autographs , as fights and gossip happen , we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each ( or others ) have played . actually , for whoever does not know the actors ( most of them being at least in their 50s ) or does not know french cinema , this movie has less interest , since most of the references will be missed , but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging , on acting , on public life . . .",1,9
"i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween/the fog/christine/the thing - probably his best films . then you got this pos . i cannot logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns . at least his son made a decent soundtrack . you have to look at this from the standpoint that it did not seem like a movie . it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing . i will not believe carpenter put any effort into this at all . i was just listening to his old school h2/h3/the fog soundtrack and it was awesome , especially for the times . he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films .",0,1
"not really spoilers in my opinion , but i wanted to cover myself , nevertheless . as the executive producer , morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less , a movie with an intentional indie-feel , and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme . he plays a alternate universe , semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman , who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson , ca from brentwood to research his next movie role . why carson , is a mystery to so . cal residents . he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements . paz vega is pretty to watch , a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz , playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research . his character is only known as ""him"" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-""psst , that is 'him , ' etc . unfortunately , i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood , carried no cash or debit card , or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does , then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has . nothing really happens in this movie . i do not believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . it flirts with the idea of adultery , but then that thought fizzles . this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl , without the sexual affair . it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience .",0,4
"no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it is a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one . while this movie is not without its interesting elements ( mullets from hell , etc . ) , it is outweighed by flaws . for one thing , angela , the murderous counselor , appears to be about the same age as the campers . having an older , more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film . and then you have the murder scenes . the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly ( no pun intended ) , although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original . but overall , there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching .",0,3
"between 1937 and 1939 , twentieth century-fox made a ton of mr . moto films . however , towards the end of the series , it was obvious that the studio had ""jumped the shark"" , so to speak . this phrase indicates that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula . for example , with ""the brady bunch"" they introduced the annoying 'cousin oliver' and with ""family ties"" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season ! with the moto films , they would jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled . in the previous film , warren hymer played an annoying wrestler . and , in this film the character archibald featherstone appears . featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever , as you kept hoping someone ( preferably moto ) would kill him just to shut him up ! ! although he is supposed to work for the famed scotland yard , he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip . again and again , his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon ""act"" . it's so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better moto films due to its clever plot . as for the plot , the crown of the queen of sheba is discovered in the opening scene . moto , now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was , is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen . in a great twist , several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other . overall , the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the moto series should have ended here . with wwii approaching , the films could not have survived much longer anyway , as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply would not have been accepted in the us or in allied countries .",0,4
"so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so i duly responded . here are some remarks . . vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed . she also looks very old and i do not think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers . i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . mamie gummer's resemblance to her mother merly streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . she is surprisingly good; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . i agree with a previous comment : natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films ( ""nell"" for example . ) both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . their interplay is weak . toni collette additionally is way too old for her character . glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time . streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo . her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . eileen atkins provides some welcome dry wit , especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to redgrave's character . as for the men; hugh dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . as a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . he also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people ( one of them a man ) are so much smitten by this man . the backstory to this should have been developed more . the cinematography is excellent as expected . however the main summer house set failed to convince me . it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill , particularly with its grass patch in the front . a bit too cardboard like . overall , the film is a classy production , but a seen-it-all-before , cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a tearjerker . however , it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time , about one's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies . . .",1,7
"sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing , and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition . these three tales are not anything as good as any from the original creepshow . by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners . the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop , makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it . the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver , but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down . watch the original creepshow instead , or if you already have done then be happy with that .",0,4
this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i did not have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie do not see it . . . but then again thats my opinion,0,4
"one of the worst movies i ever saw . my only thought was : ""how can i get my money back from hollywood video"" . this is no way worth four dollars , or any dollars . i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican , or vin diesel's movies , but it failed miserably to do this . the acting was terrible , i felt sorry for the actors that they could not find something better to do with their time . the story was ridiculous . we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors , it was so predictable . the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated , worse than a cartoon . skip it .",0,1
"an old saying goes ""if you think you have problems , visit a hospital . "" that has been updated in recent years to ""if you think you have problems , watch a tv talk show . . . especially jerry springer's ! "" this movie is one of those that is so bad , it is good ! that's why i gave it a seven-it is all right , but not great . it's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as ""an hour of your life you will never get back ! "" all the familiar themes are here . . . unfaithful husbands/boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing jerry , etc . the shocker was watching molly hagan , who normally plays sweet characters ( ""seinfeld"" and ""herman's head"" ) playing a trailer-trash mom and jaime pressly ( ""my name is earl"" ) as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . the men ( including the staff producer ) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . i do not want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . here in phoenix , it is shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and , after that , everything else seems to pale . again , i give this movie a seven . . . it is good but not great . jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses .",1,7
"to put it simply , i enjoyed this film . the reason for my interest & enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself . i had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how northern england working class life and attitudes used to be ( as experienced by them ) and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me . in particular , the paternalistic but overbearing father who ""knows"" what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged . ( not much has changed there then ! ! ) people who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media . in a sense however , the film is an historical document and i personally enjoyed it , if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon .",1,8
"why is this film so bad ? well , if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason , then this film is it . the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst . the gags are predictable but that is not what makes it bad . they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say . corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy . his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the family's crime history . however , it is not that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family . mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does not feel like any comic hijixn are there . corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again . i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes . chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film . it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb , slap stick humor . will ferrel , kattan's snl partner , seems to have made a full career out of it . the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke . there is absolutely no diversity in kattan's routine . it's hard to hear the same joke twice , but for a whole movie that is just pure torture . the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes . the gay mafia brother , the awkward guy sch-tick , and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it . it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it . even with a cast that has some comedic talent ( chris penn , peter falk ) the jokes that commence are tired . there is no chemistry too . this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors . no body seemed to care about it , or even try . sad thing is , no body told chris kattan that .",0,1

"a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store , and picking stuff just because i have not seen it . a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen . long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies ( not good ones ) , he made this better than average drama . watching it you begin to notice how many decent , good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated . contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large . . . preferably large , and unsubtle , and scandalous . kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director . ( um . no thanks ) his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot . the plague is coming ! but here's an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable barabra bel geddes , with her bathos turned way down ( well , for her ) ; they are a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones . here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment . these are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something hollywood , in its greed , now studiously avoids . these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them . it's a personable , human-scaled film , not the grotesque , overscaled production that he and others ( david lean ) will later popularize , whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge . i just watched it twice and i'll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes , but it does not seem that important to me as a viewer . this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain , and naked city , which you should really get your hands on .",1,7

"it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film ( female trouble ) , and i was not sure what to expect the second time around . while the previous film was outrageously over the top , pecker is actually a funny film that satirizes the art critics in new york to a t . anyone who cannot imagine what these ""experts"" find so appealing about modern art , will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over pecker , a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors . edward furlong ( pet sematary ii , terminator 2 : judgment day ) was surprisingly good as pecker . there was not a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film , but he really shines . christina ricci ( prozac nation ) comes in with another great performance as pecker's girlfriend . in fact , it was a banner year for ricci ( buffalo '66 , the opposite of sex , and pecker . lili taylor , who had the only good role in the haunting , was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable . there are many funny scenes , but i have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming , ""we want bush !

"hanna-barbera sucks the life out of another famous property . the violence is watered down , the stories are formulaic , the animation is bad , the music is obnoxious and repetitive , and frankly , the show just is not funny . at the time , h-b put every one of its series through the same clich d situations , regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not . thus , popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ( ""hey ! popeye is popular , and the flinstones are popular . put 'em together , and you cannot miss !

"""new best friend"" is another entry in the ""steal another woman's life"" sub-genre; the best of which are ""single white female"" and ""the hand that rocks the cradle""; the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the lifetime channel . for some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women . there are just two basic ways to play this type of story . you can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme . or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person , as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene . unfortunately the makers of ""new best friend"" could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early . we first meet alicia ( mia kirshner ) scamming the college's financial aid office for scholarship money . we now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion . but the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that alicia is a good person . this introduces the only element of suspense , not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection . ""new best friend"" suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students . there are really only two big parts , hadley ( meredith monroe ) and alicia ( kirshner ) . they were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production . it almost works for the 26 year-old kirshner when she plays the mousy version of alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamed-up version of alicia . monroe's casting is simply a joke , about like having nicholette sheridan try to pass as a classmate on ""lizzie mcgwire"" . she looks much closer to a mid-life crisis than to a term paper . the producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters . taye diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students . the basic setup is that hadley and two other rich party girls ( played by dominque swain-age 21 and rachel true-age 35 ) are undergrad roommates at college . they share ( as their student residence ) a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on real world-new orleans ( a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students ) . alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over hadley's life . at least that way swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene . swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about ""new best friend"" and her love scene with kirshner is fantastic , so cool and artsy that it does not fit with any of the other segments , maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer . the unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties , each proceeded by a shot of a comatose alicia in a hospital bed . about half of kirshner's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth . not a good career move mia . then again , what do i know ? i'm only a child .",0,4

"" i'm not a fan of monaghan . his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me , his only decent performance being in lost , so i generally try to avoid his films . i did , however , happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed . this director really knows what she is doing . of course , you are going to get the trolls ( or just ignorant people ) who do not understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it . but luckily , from what i've seen , they are in the minority when it comes to this gem . let's not deny that the film was working on no budget , and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work , because that is certainly true . the production value is very low , but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school ? pretend for a moment that the budget does not matter . if you take away a bit of the acting , the sound quality ( which actually was not the fault of the filmmaker; i saw this at a festival and the sound was fine . . . i guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up ) , and the fact it was shot on mini-dv , then what are you left with ? the story , the visual composition and the soul of the film , which are indisputably flawless . nanavati can tell a story . that much is clear . she can write substance-heavy , engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood , create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story , and bring it to life in a fascinating , creative way that , were this higher budget , might have won awards . give it more experienced actors , better sound post-production , and 35mm instead of mini-dv and even the trolls could not complain . this girl is incredible , and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago , she is done some amazing work since . the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that , and i cannot wait to see the higher budget stuff she is done . 9/10 stars , this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker .",1,10
"if you are uninitiated to the gundam world , this is a good place to start . if you are burned out on star wars or star trek , here is a compelling , realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in . not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected , but rather a complex , emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys is decidedly less than distinct . gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha , a young , naive boy living in a neutral space colony . he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends . during the course of this series , al befriends an ""enemy"" soldier , bernie wiseman . by the end , little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice . i loved this oav series , with its cool mecha designs , involving story , and likeable characters . i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime , or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment .",1,10
"there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming , in brail_ ! ! the competition ( worm farming ) had a better plot and more interesting characters . i was physically ill after watching this movie . the cheating husband ( i think dougray_scott_ ) was a joke in every meaning of the word . poor jennifer must really need the work , and what was with the accent ! ! . the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank , and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class . it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named ""this is not a laxitive"" . thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious .",0,1
"i usually start by relaying the premise of the film , but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review , let me preface it by saying that i'm someone who likes most films ( just check my other reviews ) . alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll , whose film right before this one was house of the dead ( 2003 ) . like alone in the dark , it was also a film adaptation of a video game . almost everyone hated it . well , i loved it . i even gave it a 10 out of 10 ! my point in stating this ( which will surely turn some readers off immediately ) is that if even i hated alone in the dark , there must be something wrong with it . the premise : who am i kidding ? attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states' budget , but here it goes anyway . some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe . the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world"" , which was evil in nature . the bad stuff wiped them out , but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key . later , some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal , and specifically this tribe , decided to experiment on some kids , to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world . ( believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it is just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us ) . then , there was something about the kids being in an orphanage , but the government takes them back out , and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics , and there are super humans roaming around , and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on . in fact , the exposition never really stops . it's like a neverending backstory from hell . there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films , maybe 25 . but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film . in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans , we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf , worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens , tunneling worms underground , zombies , starship trooper-like wars , evil scientists , underground lairs , gold mines , spooky warehouses , impalements , big mostly unused museums , government conspiracies , golden trunks pulled out of the sea , nuns , explosions , complex backstabbing plots , a very ambiguous romance , car chases , home invasions , kitchen sinks . . . wait , i cannot remember if that last one was in the film . even more amazingly ( amusingly ? ) , in fangoria #240 , producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying , ""we're spending much more time on story , being very meticulous about that"" . tara reid called alone in the dark ""a smarter film"" . let me not mislead anyone . a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film , but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else . i usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting , why we were there , or what anyone was doing ( at least when each scene began ) . it's just a random mishmash of settings and clich s , as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers . then when he was done , he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice , then reassembled it by throwing the i ching . sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel ( which is a combination of short , varied , unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work ) , but perhaps that is being too generous . i'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel . just as i tend to at least like most films , i tend to like most actors and most performances . it's very rare that i say that a performance was bad . well , tara reid was bad here--and i'm someone who usually likes reid . i do not know what happened . for a large percentage of the film , they just move her around the set like a prop . they might as well have just bought a blow-up doll . that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings . maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that is usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws . and speaking of that dialogue , a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla . by that , i mean that it is a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook . at least in godzilla films , there is a campiness to it , because they know how ridiculous it is , and there is a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something . just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here , besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents , is difficult to say . i cannot say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance , although maybe slater at least saw the cigar . i think that is unprecedented for me . still , i did not give this film a 1 . there was some competent cinematography , even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it , and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good . heck , even the novelette prologue was not so bad . i actually thought the film had promise at that point . but this may just be the worst film i've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more .",0,2
"before seeing this movie , please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events , particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8 , 000 muslim men were bused out of srebrenica and shot by serbian paramilitaries . the documentarian also belongs to various pro-serbian american organizations . please watch this movie critically , and read reviews beforehand . most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far , even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war . a review in the nytimes by stephen holden states that it would be ""inaccurate to label this documentary pro-serbian , "" but one should question both the presentation of facts , many of which are taken from reliable sources , and the omission of those facts that inculpate serbian forces . i do not advise against seeing this documentary , but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye ( as one should do at all times anyway ) .",0,1
"i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles ( e . g . good will hunting , the fisher king , the world according to garp ) . these are my favorite robin williams movies . but seize the day , although well-acted , is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie ( even worse than death to smoochy , club paradise , and alladin on ice ) . every good story is going to have its ups and downs . this movie , however , is one giant down . i do not need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest , but i've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness . this movie reminds me of ""love liza"" ( which is actually worse ) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall . the answer ? who cares .",0,1
"oh my , from the box description i thought it would be la-crazy like 2 days in the valley or hugo pool . ulrich seidl must be a very strong man . most , after directing this , would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder . i confess to only watching the first half hour ( for now ) . reading all the comments here , i have a lot to look forward to . professional reviews often mention the swedish film songs from the second floor as a parallel but that is graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism . what hath the marshall plan and the eu wrought ? seeing this in a theater with anyone i know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than i got through on dvd . there's a more annoying creature in the universe than jar jar binks - the hitchhiker from hell . whatever happens to her , it is not enough ! soulless suburbia that i thought only existed in arizona and florida thrives in lower austria . oh no ! i thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in new york and san francisco , and here they are in suburban shopping malls ? was it mahatma gandhi or jawaharlal nehru who said when asked about western civilization , 'why that might be a nice idea' ? if the world were truly like this film , bring on that black hole , we are ready .",1,7
"as if the film were not of value in itself , this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it . in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc; that fall in graduate school , i read the book for the first time . some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film . and for better or worse--and i've now read and taught the novel for over three decades--milo o'shea is still leopold bloom .",1,10

"tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plant's accidental release of toxic waste . unrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior . rather horrible , obviously intended to be , mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up . craft was far down troma's list of objectives for this gory sleazefest . the honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits . the german teacher who becomes a member , through a ""toxic kiss"" has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the creeps . the toxic monster , which dispatched the annoying punks towards the end , is pretty cool , though . kind of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly .",0,3

"rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre , sergio martino . fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi , this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film . it's when everything has fallen into place that we can go , ""ahh . . "" the film revolves around the death of a husband ( . . in an airplane explosion ) and the million dollars the wife receives from it . there are those with great interest in that money , one in particular being the dead man's mistress . the wife is lisa ( ida galli ) and the mistress demanding half the money is lara ( janine reynaud ) . she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money . lara says she will use her ""lawyer"" , sharif ( luis barboo ) to get that money . so already , the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa , who awaiting someone in tokyo . george hilton portrays peter lynch . peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means . when , on his watch , lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room , he is a possible suspect . he decides to do a little investigating himself , while also assisting inspector stavros ( luigi pistilli ) and interpol agent , benton ( tom felleghy ) on their quest to find a killer . the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa . soon , the film follows a journalist , cl o dupont ( the delicious , luscious anita strindberg ) as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her . soon they fall deeply in love , but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed . soon someone attacks cl o with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory . why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people . this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow . the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer . this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken ( the throat and lower torso ) . the film's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying . the film has some unique camera angles , but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery .",1,8
"really , really bad slasher movie . a psychotic person escapes from an asylum . three years later he kills a sociology professor , end of scene . one semester yesterday later ( hey , that is what the title card said ) a new sociology professor is at the school . she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there , and starts dating another professor . the students are all bored , as are we . there are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed . scenes are pretty short , and cut to different characters somewhere else , making for little progression of any kind . a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking , or sitting and talking , and serve little purpose . despite the passage of time , many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing . sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time , we ask ourselves : how long has that body been there ? and also , at least one of the dead people do not seem to have been missed by others . the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast , another by stabbing him in the crotch , and another by slicing her forehead . is his knife poisoned or something ? the video box cover has a cheerleader : there are not any in the movie . the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room . the central redhead in the photo is in the movie , but nobody ever wears such an outfit , and there is no such scene . the killer is strictly one-on-one .",0,2

"it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl . . . this film has a nice concept-the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist . it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate . . . a nice start you might say , but then it got a bit greedy , very greedy , it tries to be a science fiction , a drama , a thriller , a possible romantic love story , fairy tale , a comedy and everything under the sun . the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate . for example , the scene when the girl ( played by risa goto ) finally woken by his ( yuki kohara ) kiss , instead of being romantic , it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards . . . it is a cheap trick , because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film . i have not read the original story the film is base on ( it is the well-known work by the comic-book artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories ) i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption ? it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the ""fussy logic"" of those japanese comic-book . for instance , how did yuki kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant ( when its suppose to be a long bus-ride away ) to run away risa goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television ? there are also some scenes that is directly copied ( very uncreative ! ) from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie . the famous ""the lion mouth has caugh my hand"" scene from ""the ""roman holiday"" the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing . . . it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy . . . and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ""ghost"" movie . nevertheless , one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager . it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said ""this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age"" , it would have definitly been on the poster of this film .",0,2

"this is a pretty ok film . . . yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient , and the movie does not really justify the large star cast ( ab , sd , tanuja ) . however , the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon ( not to be confused with the singer kk ) . in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character , i thought that a man who can just look at ab , keep staring and not say a word , and still look strong , is definitely a good actor . in fact , he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar , alongside ab for a second time . this guy should get more roles , he is brilliant . if you have read any of the other reviews here on imdb , you already know the plot , and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy . and the little love angle he shared with ""what is-her-face"" was completely unnecessary . but he is a fairly good actor ( as seen in dch ) , sunjay dutt is cool to watch , always . and ab . . . what can i say . i do not know if i'm his biggest fan in the world , but i know i can definitely compete for the spot . an interesting watch , considering it is bollywood , although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like ""the great escape"" and ""bridge on the river kwai"" .",1,7
"this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung . it eschews the soft wistfulness of ""all that heaven allows"" and the weepy sentimentality of ""imitation of life"" and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension . and of course , it is all captured in vibrant technicolor . the cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall , but who is really paying attention to the story ? dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as stack's sister , who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will . a highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom , unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety . as so frequently happens in sirk movies , the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness . sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art , satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films . his was a unique talent and i do not know that there is ever been another film maker quite like him since . grade : a-",1,8
"there are some nice shots in this film , it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light , in fact the cinematography is probably it is best asset . but it is basically more of a made for tv movie , and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot , which keeps it quite interesting viewing , there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish , so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost . i had it as a xmas gift , as it is a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented , and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in ""a time to kill"" , and the ""the newton boys "" so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work . however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy , he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film , he is basically an extra and he does not exactly light up the screen while he is on , so die hard fans , really not worth it from that point of view . the films star though , patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye , and his character is just so nice and kind and caring , a true saint of a guy , he would be well written into a rom com . so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen , i'd recommend , ""a time to kill"" , ""the newton boys "" ""frailty"" , ""how to lose a guy in 10 days"" , ""edtv"" and ""amistad"" and avoid too ""larger than life"" and ""angels in the outfield"" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent , but are quite amusing films for children , again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines . as for scorpion springit is not a bad film but it also is not screen stealing either .",0,4
"the perfect son is a story about two 30-something brothers , one who is seemingly ""perfect"" and the other who is basically a screw-up , frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers . after the death of their father , the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces . it is not until the ""perfect"" brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order , and take some responsibility . the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother's ""comeback"" , though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times ( beating drug addiction is never so easy ) . what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids , a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 years . and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well-done . the two main actors were both very competent , if not terribly charismatic . a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids . the ending is nicely done as well .",1,7

"i remember watching this movie when i was young , but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself ""that is the title ? "" this movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it . it is also somewhat boring too , as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such . the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants . i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby , but do not quote me on that . the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too . what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through . in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants .",0,3

"monster - he was great; i loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of ""the creature from the black lagoon . "" the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping . social commentary : much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors ( under orders from the government ) state that sars-like disease is out there . in a nutshell , we get the familiar government cover-up story . you know , i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt , but it looks like the koreans are copying the format , and it is very tedious . in here , it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this ""monster . "" it just drags the film down . the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family , presumed dead , was hauled off by the creature . moral : a typical ""do not pollute the water"" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster . this used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants , spiders , fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films . now its ""environmental issues"" that are the focus . the humor this was mostly stupid . i normally laugh at slapstick but this was not funny . i do not know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful , or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old ""godzilla"" movies . let's hope it is the latter . transfer - the video transfer was good . this was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise . i watched this in korean with the english subtitles . that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour . overall - this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots , which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film . two hours was way too long for this story . how this film drew record crowds in korea i do not know . they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support .",0,3

"the brain ( or head ) that wouldn't die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s . it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody . and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead , ginny leith - a detached head kept alive by machines , i-vs and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes . shades of the under-rated boxing helena . the genderisms are plentiful , and about as irritating as an army of angry ants . the dialog is hyperbolic , over-dramatic and unbelievable , and the acting is merely ok ( but not consistent ) . why have i given this film a 4 ? because some thought clearly went into it . i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make , but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror ( without the blood and guts today's audiences expect ) . another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film , and none of the characters are particularly likable . all considered , this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality , from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash . her lover is threatening to sew a fresh , high quality , body onto her and force her to continue living with him . she is understandably non-plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend . oh , there are also some vague references to the 1950s/60s clich about the evils of science run amok . recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies . o/w not recommended .",0,4

"i've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review , but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that i'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest- and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality . this is a dull , boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists' target ( a john bolton-esquire bully diplomat who is really a great guy , do not you know ) and of the oh-so-handsome and popular dr . phil ( whose bestselling book , one learns , is read by frequent fliers worldwide ) . the only real red eye i experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbelief . before you fork out $10 or so dollars for this b movie , read the selected 'quotes ( from trailer ) ' above , and ask yourself if you will really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found . unfortunately , nothing else in this film is any better . the basic premise is goofy as hell; the acting is bland and uninspired , completely lacking in pro/antagonist chemistry; the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn- except during the last five minutes- by poor directing and anticipatory editing; the script is riddled with incongruities like : early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick; and the plot holes are wider than first class ( while character development is strictly coach ) . and then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness , like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security , at her first opportunity , to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of homeland security and her father . or when that same woman runs hell-bent-for-leather along slick airport linoleum , arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging , while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels . or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea . or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom . i'm always willing to suspend disbelief , but i'm not going to leap from 30 , 00 feet without a parachute . the one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable ( even in bimbo form ) of handling the most extreme emergencies- the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in american movies . other than that , this movie never really takes off , and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny . remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes- in this forum or elsewhere ? this is one of those times . wait for the red eye video , and do not watch it then , either .",0,1
"robert altman's downbeat , new-fangled western from edmund naughton's book ""mccabe"" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following . aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario , the characters here do not merit much interest , and the picture looks ( intentionally ) brackish and unappealing . bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in , beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action . altman creates a solemn , wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place , but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and altman's pacing is deliberately slow . there's hardly a statement being made ( just the opposite , in fact ) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds . it's a self-defeating picture , and yet , in an altman-quirky way , it wears defeat proudly . ** from ****",0,4

"a trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit ( doing his job ) ; he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother ( there is a child in the back seat ) ; he then is telling her what is wrong and bam . . . they get killed . okay , this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie . when i was watching this movie in the theatre i was with some friends . this was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie . we all decided to see a suspense/thriller that looked good to everyone in the group . . . this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life . not only did i waste $7 . oo on a movie ticket , but i had to sit through torture for the brain . this movie started off with mystery and suspense and i seriously thought ""this cant be bad"" . . . i was so wrong . the whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting , the ""not so scary"" storyline , and the over all horrible mess this movie was , you will still be puzzled . it's not because you are not smart enough to understand it , it is because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about . right now you may be thinking ""oh man ! i have to watch this movie just to see if it is as bad as this person says it is"" . get that thought out of your head right now ! ! ! i'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it . please people do not make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential . . . it does not . i give this movie 1 out of 10 ( if i could give a zero i would ) , and i do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie , you will be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w . t . f . that freaking movie is about .",0,1
"as a pagan , i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance . it's a ""fun"" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all , and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way . that's a lesson everyone needs to learn , not just pagans . that having been said , this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart . hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca , elsa lanchester ( with too many movie credits to mention except as ms . jane marbles of ""murder by death"" ) was wonderful as ms . novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie . also starring jack lemmon ( wonderful performance ) and jim kovacs ( brilliantly witty ) .

"this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly , just painfully mediocre . lacking any real wit or imagination , a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the `jokes' ( which are predictable and threadbare ) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer . another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what `shocked' or amused us 30 years ago does not work quite the same way now . we've seen it all before , and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated . a major miss .",0,2
"saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene . a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars . only wish i could find it again ! would certainly buy/view it if i could . please , somebody , bring it back . fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii , and his leading ladies , joan leslie , and especially june haver were beautiful and charming . it was a musical , but also romantic , funny , and clever . this was my favorite movie starring june haver , although i always liked her . her dazzling smile lit up the screen , and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film . the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles . a well-balanced and light-hearted film; only wish we had more like it !",1,10
"the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team ""networth"" vs . the supposed professional team ""magna"" but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you would be right . while the magna team has struggled at times , the street team has simply disintegrated week after week . first some things to reiterate as far as the ""apprentice 3"" first of it continues the same absurd mentality ( from trump ) and the game in this series : if your a good project manager , but you lose , the team will turn on you and you will be fired , despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs . simply absurd , that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually ""weeds"" out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol anyone this season , weve seen a total of cursing , backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns . the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell , audrey evans , danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump , the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict , anger and suffering . it's just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game . yes its the game , it is ""the apprentice"" where manipulation , backstabbing , and always popular ""everyone gang up on the project manager"" mentality rules . it has been an entertaining ride , though , the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses , to building of new apartments . still though it is still the ""apprentice"" though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner .",1,10
"prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes' , what with stories of fights , chaos , murder and of course extreme male bonding ! but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether . horror films set in cells are , as you probably know , nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape two of the greatest themes in horror cinema . with such examples as the chair ( waldermar korzeniowsky , 1988 ) , the green mile ( frank darabont , 1999 ) , alien 3 ( david fincher , 1992 ) and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself , another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised . or at least that is what you would have thought . prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it is somewhat of a shame that it is not as well known as it should be . the film , in short , centres on an old prison ( well , duh ! ) which has been reopened . however , it is not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear , but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind; death ! and boy , are we treated to some awesome death scenes ! i will not spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands . besides the special effects and the murders , this film also has another thing going for it; it is cast . headlining , we have lord of the rings ( peter jackson , 2001-2003 ) star viggo mortensen ( and for all those so inclined , yes , he does get naked ) whose performance is not only highly believable , but is done with such skill that his eastwood-esquire character is both bad-to-the-bone and likable ( a very delicate mix ) . add him to a cast of 'hey-wait-a-minute-i-know-that-guy' actors and you have got yourself one great set of stars . the characters themselves however lack three-dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical . we've got a black oculist , a hard-as-nails prison warden , a human-rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters . but in all honesty , this 'fault' actually aids the film . instead of boring character development in an over-long equilibrium , we are chucked , more or less , straight into the action and once it gets going ( very early on ) there is not a single scene that is a filler it is balls to the wall plot . unlike a certain shawshank redemption ( frank darabont , 1994 ) ! sharing conventions with the slasher genre , this is somewhat of a convention itself , and , in good ol' slasher genre tradition , prison punishes those who have been bad . all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world . with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans . don't be fooled into thinking it will be a cheesy little film either , just because it was made in usa 1980s , it is far from cheesy ( although the very end does ruin this ) and , simultaneously , far from gritty and realistic ( whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape , these are rather subtly done ) . i give it 3 . 5 out of 5 luvs . a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed .",1,7
"i love korean films because they have the ability to really ( quiet eerily really ) capture real life . i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone . i've seen this directors other movies before . the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is oasis and another awesome film called this charming girl . however , my title summary is supposed to be from a chrstian perspective so i'll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise . for a non christian perspective director chang-dong lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern protestant church ( regardless of denomination ) warts and all . i've always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life . because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to . many films with religious undertones , though having good motives , tend to just have the resonance of a disney film or after school special . they need to show life as it is . real people curse , real people lust , real people fall . and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it , we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life . and do-yeon jeon's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god , but because of life's bitter realities , loses that love for him she once had . she does not deny god exists . it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and forgiving god . in her decent to the edges of morality and madness , her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one , religious or not . ""if god is love , why does he allow such terrible things to happen ? "" this film does not answer that , rightly so . and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film , though open to interpretation , leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of ""secret sunshine"" full circle . i do not believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that . there in lies the reason why it worked even more . it's real , it is honest . and because of that , it is by far the best summation of a real christian life i have seen on film .",1,10
"i am curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism . whatever the director's intention , the two do not really mesh together . the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics . there is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies , dr . king , serious political interviews , flopping breasts , and pubic hair . the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie . other than the interesting sex scenes , you will be bored dry watching this film . unlike many other reviewers , i think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is . if you want to see real porn , i'm sure there are better choices . the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is . i think the cast did a fine job however . they played their parts believably . there is little of the over-the-topness i'm so used to seeing in the american films during this time .",0,3

"hello playmates . i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey , i have to admit i was very impressed by this film . as a fan of black and white films generally , passport to pimlico , the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder ( who is apparently a distant relative ) , this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour . i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance , however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now . if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it , shame these films generally are not shown on sunday afternoons anymore . i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley ( private godfrey in dad's army ) . i thank you",1,9
"oh dear . yet another example of "" oireland "" and religion . no doubt we will be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some "" hunky and macho freedom fighters "" from the ira . well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock . what a superb movie the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s . there is a slight problem since they are getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they are old enough . the story - which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they will be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford . from there things escalate let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he would love it and call it a masterpiece ? perhaps i should not since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i do not claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there is no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila is not blameless herself . think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . there's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member ( that makes a change . we're not talking about the devil's own here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which i agree with . if there is any sort of criticism it is that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses",1,8
"you would not expect a movie like this to be good , and it is not . it's a no budget , ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera . . . and it is hilarious . the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings . there is no plot to be seen . the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families . the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen . it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts , and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs . it's a funny and sickening film , and it is about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie . my rating : bomb/**** . 90 mins .",0,1

"after witnessing his wife ( linda hoffman ) engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy , the already somewhat unstable dentist dr . feinstone ( corbin bernsen ) completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients . this delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties . although the dentist' is intended to be a cheesy , fun little film , yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense . despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters , and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days , the movie is intriguing , generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest , even during the more ludicrous of moments . the dentist' suffers , on occasion , from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel , there are only sporadic uninteresting moments , and in general the movie follows itself nicely . corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic , deranged and perfectionist dr . alan feinstone . the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines , especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex ( particularly fellatio ) , is something short of marvellous . while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous , bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable . had the dentist' not been intended to be a fun , almost comical , horror movie , bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful . sadly , the rest of the cast ( including a pre-fame mark ruffalo ) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this , stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick . the dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable , particularly ( i would presume ) for fans of cheesy horror . those who became annoyed at the number of scream' ( 1996 ) clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change , as i did . a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's . on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and ( on the whole ) realistic scenes of dental torture , which should keep most gorehounds happy . far from perfect but far from bad as well , the dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once . my rating for the dentist' 6 . 5/10 .",1,7

"a novel by remarque . a cast that looks great on paper . a left-wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars . a gestapo officer undercover . it's a pity there is no synergy here . the bits and pieces never coalesce . stories about left-wing refugees in france do not have to be this dull . read arthur koestler's memoir ""scum of the earth"" ( if you can find it ) . or his chilling ""dialogue with death"" ( ditto ) . to me , the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details . the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados , the norman apple brandy . i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself . it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly . but , according to the film , it is only sold in cheap , low-class saloons . vive le tabac parisien ! that's what i say . references to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists . i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background . i was not disappointed . this time it was for byrrh , a very unusual choice . this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals . the film's indifferent score is by louis gruenberg . gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera ""the emperor jones"" , based on the o'neill play . it premi red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson . the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett . it should surface again soon though; they are running out of potentially marketable operas to revive . opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer's character operates under his ""czech"" aliases . two of them are ""wozzeck"" and ""gunther"" , both prominent roles in german opera . is that just coincidence ? name-dropping just seems to be part of this film . notice that they call up ""himmelstoss"" on the phone . himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque's earlier ""all quiet on the western front"" . well , the in-jokes are all in place; guess there was not time to develop any drama .",0,3

"i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something , he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general ! now , i do not know about others , but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share . however , the powerful elite obviously were not going to go for that . so , rather than understanding what che guevera wanted , they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution . it did not work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off . a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba . as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died : ""if you kill me , that is fine . but you are only killing a man , you will never kill the cause !

"a painfully protracted , maudlin and predictable drama , my twenty-fifth sidney lumet film , garbo talks , gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest . the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert ( ron silver ) , who is son to estelle rolle ( anne bancroft ) , eccentric , feisty and above all , an obsessive fan of greta garbo . when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor , her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own : track down greta garbo , and bring her to his mother . anne bancroft is in full-on , chew-the-scenery auntie-mame mode here , that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves , where she mouths off to people , and stands up for her ideals , and ends up in jail all the time . she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct , and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; every note striking false . the rest of the characters are equally as one-dimensional , but tremendously less-interesting . ron silver is flat as can be , and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film : he is dating affluent lisa rolfe ( carrie fisher ) , but becomes smitten with oddball co-worker jane mortimer ( catherine hicks ) , and i called every scene three scenes before they happen . that's the other problem . one-dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story , but there is simply nothing here . the film's pace is glacial , resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing , and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot , it is both plodding and uninteresting . there are plenty of guest stars , so to speak , including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker ( imagine that ) in yet another highly inessential scene . late in the film , it attempts to make a halfway-decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives , but by that time , none of the characters exist as real people , and the film had bored me into submission , so it functions as a case of far-too-little , far-too-late . the film is my twenty-fifth lumet-directed film , making him easily my most-viewed director , but outside of a couple egregious misses ( a stranger among us , anyone ? ) , he has not plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks . {grade : 4 . 5/10 ( c/c- ) / #21 ( of 24 ) of 1984 / #23 of 25 lumet films}",0,4
"this adaptation of pearl s . buck's film is certainly a classic . a true hollywood epic , it has all the things a great hollywood film has : birth , death , happiness , sadness , exhilaration , despair , and so on . there is only one thing that irks me . i know it was a sign of the times , but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors . paul muni was a great actor , and he does an admirable job as wang lung , the owner of a farm in china . luise rainier plays olan . she does not even look chinese ! i think she tried to get the role , but they should have put anna may wong in the role . i know why they did not , and ms . rainier is very good in the film , but they hardly tried to make her look ""authentic"" . stillm its a great film , especially if you read the book ( i did in high school , decades ago ) . its a must see , just look beyond the casting . i think you can .",1,9
"yet again one of the most misunderstood goddesses of my country has been twisted by ""westerners"" who cannot understand the esoteric symbolism of the mother goddess in her dark forms . the mother takes on the frightening form of kali mata to destroy our inner demons , and to terrify our egos . and though blood sacrifice is given to kali and durga , the events depicted in this film are just absurd . the mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons , limitations , and ego when no other form will suffice . it's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your karmas in the ""smashan"" fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her , and she will bring you to reality and truth . reality and truth has a dark side as well as light , which serves a purpose . the mother is the embodiment of the physical universe as well , she is nature . nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance . you cannot have growth and life without death and destruction . kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe . it's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of india or it is divinity can just take one of our beloved goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low-budget , talentless horror film . how dare they take our beloved mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off ! ? she is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion , greed , anger , and other inner-demons . it's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self-deluding ego , and serious inner-demons to see kali as so horrible and terrible . when the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting , beautiful , and young , a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire universe with it . kali maa is an ancient mother , not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment , let us just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie . the audacity that westerners have in using religions like my own , or the religions of the caribbean islands such as santeria , and vodou which are actually very positive , and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the western mind cannot comprehend , is totally ridiculous . it's clear that there is no respect for what people live , breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks . kali maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother , whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for . and i am happy that my mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces . many praises to the real kali maa , who has shown many the path of god and realization .",0,1
"i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much . it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor/actress to get people , any people to come see it and give the movie exposure . bobby myeres played by modine and his partner saul - paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bates , a ""name"" actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie . my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie . if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you . low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content .",1,7
"i found this movie boring , monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried , shallow ""upbeat"" ending that did not ring true to the overall story . following these characters through a weekend of awful events , unfriendly attitudes and bad news just is not my idea of a watchable , interesting movie and i got very tired of its ""one note"" theme and could not wait for it to end--in fact i almost stopped about halfway through . the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering , and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant , though the acting was good . a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry , but it just did not make it with me , and i love good , small films ! this one just did not jell , though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would . i was disappointed , especially after two local reviewers put it on their ""year's 10 best"" list . i'd strongly recommend watching ""the house of sand"" instead--now there is a good , small film !",0,3
"i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this ! i have not seen such a bad movie for years . omg this was a really bad movie . splatter , is not enough to describe the unnecessary ( nearly funny ) blood scenes ) . if you did not like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween ( 2007 ) . . well this is 10 time worse . the story remind me rl stine goosebumps . ! i cannot tell about the acting since the script was so terrible . clich all the time . ( why i must write 10lines ? i never understood this . ) ==here comes spoilers== the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro . we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice . actually those people are just missing . and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery ( well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy ) and as usual no one believes him ! what a surprise ! in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher !",0,1
"just finished this movie . . . saw it on the video shelf and being a nick stahl fan i just had to rent it . in all honesty , it probably should have stayed on the shelf . the concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow i guessed almost all of them before they came along . and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion . . . if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you will see what i mean ! on a positive note , nick stahl's acting was great ( especially considering what he had to work with ) . eddie kaye thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character . . . too much paul finch from ""american pie"" coming through for my liking . and finally , the worst part of this movie has to be january jones' emotionless performance . . . i guess a pretty face really is all that matters in hollywood .",0,4
"french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene . mal fique preceded the revival just slightly , but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made ! mal fique was obviously shot on a low budget , but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film , and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner . the plot focuses on two main ideas; prison and black magic . the central character is a man named carr re , sent to prison for fraud . he is put in a cell with three others; the quietly insane lassalle , body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy . after a short while in the cell together , they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal . after translating part of it , they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls . black magic is a very interesting topic , and i'm actually quite surprised that there are not more films based on it as there is so much scope for things to do with it . it's fair to say that mal fique makes the best of it is assets as despite it is restraints , the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout . director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film; the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic , and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it is very easy to get behind them ! it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people , and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner , and this helps to ensure that mal fique actually does manage to be quite frightening ! the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done . anyone worried that the film will not deliver by the end will not be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying ! overall , mal fique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - highly recommended viewing !",1,9
"so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off . for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie , there was just very little excitement . the acting was atrocious , to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes ( the church lady for example ) . the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin , although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring . rather then get the police involved -- which i'm sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister . i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too , which the movie then fades to black . bad dialog , bad acting , bad ending .",0,3
"well , i have to say , this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i did not have to review it for work . and the worst part is , i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city , paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong . vince vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time i've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta . anyways , the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview , but it is filled with totally ridiculous , predictable , weak plot turn points . and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didn""t have to be saved , and that santa did not need a replacdmetn , but nope . the only cool part was the sleigh rides , and the little bladck kid was the best character . i'm sure this movie would be great for young kids , but for adults it is so lame that it is chore to sit through .",0,1
"other reviewers have summarized this film noir well . i just wanted to add to the ""whew ! "" comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook's obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode . this was a doozy , i must say . cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance . a bit of trivia that i am surmising about : cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film , ""ball of fire . "" he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming , most energetically . is it too much to suggest that cook's spazzy drumming in the later film , ""phantom lady , "" was very much inspired by krupa's work , as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier ? if you watch krupa in ""ball of fire , "" i think you will note some clearly similar body movements . one hopes , of course , that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time !",1,9
"i am a huge fan of say anything , jerry maguire , and almost famous ( i was not that big on singles ) , so it is safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to . i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably would not like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowe's other films . well , having just seen it , let me say that the former was correct , and the latter could not have been more wrong . it is a very weird movie , and nothing really comes together until the end . anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory . anyway , the movie was stellar , and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released . i was moved by the film , and felt emotionally spent by the end . this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion , if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot . in the theatre in which i saw the movie , there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot . i'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this . i do not mean that to sound pompous , but some people are more cut out for the seagal , chan , van damme genre of movies , and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie . it is very cerebral , so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender , as well as much thought afterwards . as far as comparing this film to other crowe movies , it is very similar in at least one regard , in all crowe movies , the soundtrack is a character unto itself . this is almost definitely due to crowe's longstanding ties to music , as anyone who has seen almost famous knows , and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson . it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise's acting and crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire . in my mind , that is not a bad thing . anyway , if i had to compare this movie to any one other film , i would say this : if you enjoyed david fincher's the game , you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky .",1,10
"just cause takes some of the best parts of three films , cape fear , a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film . sean connery is a liberal law professor , married to a former assistant district attorney , kate capshaw and he is a crusader against capital punishment . blair underwood's grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal . he's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl . when connery arrives in this rural florida county he is up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who is about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil . later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he is uncovered , he is feeling pretty good about himself . at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear . to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly . the cast uniformly turns in some good performances . special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood . he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he is been basing his convictions on . many a confirmed liberal i've known has come out thinking quite differently once they have become a crime victim . of course the reverse is equally true . many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed . criminal justice is not an end , but a process and a never ending one at that for all society . i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it .",1,7

"paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'basic instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller . verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films , both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why . the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve ( played by jeroen krabb ) ; a gay , alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes . while there , he meets the seductive christine halsslag ( ren e soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him , even if it kills him . paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film , and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it . many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be , but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration , and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on . paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself , and that is one of things i like best about him . this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that does not happen very often ! ) . i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work . . . but you will see what i mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version ! ) . there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned , but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions , another one has a pipe sent through his skull , a boat is smashed in half . . . lovely . the acting in the fourth man is not anything to write home about , but it is solid throughout . jeroen krabb holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer . it is ren e soutendijk that impresses the most , though , as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale . her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct , but the original fatale did it best . paul verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view , all of which help to create the mystery of the story . verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish , but he obviously has talent and it is a shame that he does not put it to better use . of all the verhoeven films i've seen , this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me , it is worth the effort .",1,9

"perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini ( who wrote the novel on which this film is based ) . it's a neorealist fantasy , kind of an oxymoron , really . an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son . after a few years , the baby is a young boy ( named toto ) and the adoptive mother is dying . he goes to an orphanage and , when he finally turns 18 , he leaves . immediately , he finds that he has no home . toto is optimistic , though , and will not let anything get him down . a man steals his valise , and instead of getting angry over it , toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown . toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown . soon , the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land , and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves . after many attempts , the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless . at this point , the film becomes full-fledged fantasy ( before this it was more comedic/fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin ) . this stuff is so weird and shocking that it is probably best for others to see it for themselves . it's quite amazing , and very funny . there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan , most certainly . fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism . i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release . at this point , though , it is so enjoyable - i loved it very much . it might be my favorite of vittorio de sica's films , although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very , very close . 10/10 .",1,10

"forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema , especially from the 1950s . there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds , but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough . it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at ( though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates ) , but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we do not know we are channeling it . on the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard , if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b-movies of the period . a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before . but the only one left is dr . morbis ( walter pidgeon ) and his daughter , who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead . morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man , and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts , led by the skipper ( leslie nielsen ) , can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth . but there is a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship , one by one , every night , even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence , which the invisible something goes through easily . meanwhile , there is some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira , and there is a more pushy vibe from the doctor : you should not have come to the planet to start , and now you need to go . what happens from this is even more fascinating , just on a purely intellectual level , but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas . while everyone may remember robbie the robot , and for good reason , perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail , animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia . the acting from pidgeon is subtle : you would not expect him to be a villain , though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this , and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect . and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent , from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook ( who , i should add , helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides ) . and the effects for its time are extraordinary ( sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too ) , and the music , done by electronics , is beautiful in its ""tones"" . but ultimately it is the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b-movie lot . when it is meant to be funny , it is intentionally so and it works . when it is dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors . and when we are made to think about a horrible situation , it comes on gradually , with nuance , not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action . an inspiration for many other sci-fi films , and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old , it is a classy and entertaining classic .",1,10

"there is a story ( possibly apocryphal ) about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys . gilliam ( allegedly ) produced a long list ( think about the aircraft one from the fifth element ) and handed it to butch bruce . it was entitled ""things bruce willis does when he acts"" . it ended with a simple message saying : ""please do not do any of the above in my movie"" . there is a fact about this movie ( definitely true ) . gilliam did not have a hand in the writing . i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary ( if not commercial ) success that is the twelve monkeys . visually , the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film . it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general ( but magnificent ) strangeness . gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience . although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real , gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork , bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate . it is this journey , and the character developments they undergo , which unsettles . i love gilliam films ( brazil , in particular ) . but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness . he seems to have so many ideas , and so much enthusiasm , that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess ( brazil , in particular ) . i still maintain that brazil is gilliam's tour de force , but there is no denying that the twelve monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department . style , substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-python . whatever the truth of the rumour above , gilliam also manages to get a first rate ( and very atypical ) performance out of the bald one . bruce is excellent in this film , as are all the cast , particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - brad pitt . it's been over a decade since this film was released . when i watched it again , i realised that it had not really aged . i had changed , of course . and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes . this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that , partly at least , is about reflections in mirrors , altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make . a first rate film . 8/10 .",1,8
"edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least ""artful"" objects imaginable . everyday items such as crates , boxes , metal containers , etc . - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by burtynsky's camera . he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them , that is . even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky's lens ( but did not we already know that from ""wall-e"" ? ) . he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures ( i . e . the workers in those places ) , with their uniform clothing and robotic movements , become part of the industrial landscape . ""manufactured landscapes , "" a documentary about burtynsky's work , has much of the feel of a ""koyaanisqatsi"" about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns . indeed , director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms , as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china , a dockyard in bangladesh , and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china . with their fluid camera-work , the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of burtynsky's images . in fact , the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows . the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the ""themes"" of his work , which , quite frankly , come out sounding confused , contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best . but it is as a purely aesthetic experience , highlighting image and form , that ""manufactured landscapes"" resonates most . in the case of burtynsky , perhaps , a picture really is worth a thousand words .",1,7

". . . would probably be the best word to describe this film ( in my opinion ) . besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls ( well , that was redundant~ ) , it was the story that blew me away . hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt ! and i know some people will disagree with me on this one , but it was not any of the big three actors ( the guys that played sho , son , and kei ) that gave the best performance ( for me , anyway ) . it was taro yamamoto , boy #5 from battle royale ! do not get me wrong , i like hyde , i worship his voice , but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off' , but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys . and gackt was not at all that bad too , i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start . nothing much i can say about my background on lee-hom wang , i will not pretend to know him , but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast . this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations i've ever heard , orenji no taiyou ( forgive my spelling if it is wrong ) . while the complete song lasts about nine minutes , you would not notice the length because you would be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together . anyway , this movie is a must-see not only for the fans ( huge fan base~ ) but for those who enjoy sci-fi , futuristic movies , asian-style .",1,9

"some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough . well , if you regard it as an action movie , this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting . however , i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one . the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences . tomas beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills , looked as if he was cold-hearted . however , after beccket showed his day dream of montana , we can clearly see his softness inside . it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted . millar , on the contrary , was a new comer , a green hand , and was even not qualified as a sniper . billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to ""put a bullet through one's heart"" ( as what beccket said ) . what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award . these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities . these two snipers quarreled , suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other . sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one .",1,8

"ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it is unisol's best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie , who is been through countless hours of training and combat with him , to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new , stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated , intelligent , and agile . all of the new unisols , which are faster and stronger than their predecessors , are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth , a self-evolving thought helix . when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts , he takes matters into his own ""hands"" to protect himself . killing those who try to shut off his power , and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers , led by the musclebound romeo , seth spares deveraux , only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours . with the help of a hacker named squid , seth takes human form . not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin , who will not leave his side , but luc also must contend with general radford , who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth . seth has also kidnapped luc's injured 13-year-old daughter hillary , and is now holding her hostage . luc is the only person who can rescue hillary , because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks , feels , and fights . now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him . with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces did not melt and reform him ( terminator 2 ) . another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it is completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is . the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you would rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that . the good points are there is no dolph ( hooray ) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many ( i'm still haunted by the scenes in #1 ) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists ( if you do not believe me look it up )",0,3

"murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to ""the end of the line"" . . . tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated , made-for-tv knock-off hurt my eyes . it cannot possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know -sight unseen- but that does not mean this update should be seen as a separate entity , either . although based on the original paramount screenplay , there is over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what is left imminently forgettable . with rare exception , the younger generation was not interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 ( still true today , alas ) so this lurid , compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers; then as now , ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre . gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels , so much the better . i loved the james m . cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair , halter tops , turbans , ugly decor , and lush auburn locks of ""guest star"" samantha eggar , who did not try too hard . in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube , lee j . cobb was able to hold my interest as a world-weary , tired-looking keyes but richard crenna's affable and inoffensive walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a bad day . improvement upon the original was , of course , never intended in a rush to make a buck but , instead of a mindless retread , a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea . cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer . the completist in me is thankful this speeded up ""me decade"" update was included as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original , it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better-made columbo tv series . i also flashed back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i have not seen since its initial airing : john d . macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's ( sexy john saxon ) wife and then frames her mild-mannered husband for the crime and , if i remember correctly , there is also an open-ended ending . like double indemnity , it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband .",0,4
"such is the dilemma ( above ) that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses . debbie has just hit town , become a stewardess , slept with an elderly rich man ( who she describes is in his 50's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago ) , shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met , and then is the central element to a kidnapping/extortion plot . through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching , what in heaven's name will debbie do ? well , i cannot give it away completely but do not expect any real epiphany here . let's face it . naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to be ( at least two-thirds through ) : a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70's way film . there is no grand art here . the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes . by todays standards , the film is pretty tame . what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end . c'mon , anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life . she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that . and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand ? it did not make sense to me so how on earth did these characters ""dig"" it ? anyone buying cal as a member of the plo ( something like that ) or even as a director for hardcore pornography ? he would be luck to get work at seven eleven ! this is , as another reviewer noted , more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece . you can tell when al is in complete charge . there is virtually no budget and the film does not look nearly as polished as this . adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree . while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be , it has a certain style to it . i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs . i even liked the music of sparrow . ""silver heels"" was a somewhat catchy tune . the movie does not look cheap really at all . compare that to any of al's horror films . as for the cast , yes , bob livingston is a bit old for the lead , but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well . i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role . the girls have all got great sets , so what else was required of them huh ? naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade . by the way , did i mention it is a pretty bad picture ?",0,4
"i like this film for several reasons . i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi . i also enjoy films ( like topkapi and big deal on madonna street ) that spoof the the genre . one of the best ones is disorganized crime . corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years , and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town . but he has not given any details on the crime to the fellows , nor do they really know each other at all . shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen ( ed o'neill and daniel roebuck ) whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back . while he is in their custody the four cons ( fred gwynne , lou diamond philips , ruben blades , and will russ ) show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something . the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other , with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other . at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from o'neill and roebuck again - not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed . the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film : the four cons trying to figure out what bernsen's scheme was , and how to put it into operation , and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin ( and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of ) . there is also a third , smaller , plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair . there are many delightful moments in the film , such as axton , egged on by o'neil and roebuck , into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of , and yelling ( through a megaphone , ""come out , we have you surrounded ! ! "" , only to have the scene switch to a huge , montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment . there are moments of misadventures by our four cons , who fortunately put the oldest ( gwynne ) into leadership position . this does not always guarantee anything . at one point their car will not start , and they have to thumb a ride by truck . unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure . the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery , including disabling all the police cars at the critical time ( philips specialty is cars ) is also a gem of timing , suspense , and comic results . the film is very entertaining , and certainly worth watching .",1,10
"this movie is one of my very favorites . it's hard to explain why . maybe it is the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak , but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack . also , some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves . finally , the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings , and the last scene is so bittersweet . all in all , i love this movie; it is perfect for a gooey , sentimental girls' night .",1,10
"for starters , i did not even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet . i have not once seen it on tv before in my country , and a lot of people do not usually know about this show . it is a pity though , because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years . i do not hand out 10 points a lot , but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points . even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though . when the complete story unfolds itself , you know that this is a real deep storyline , with a spiritual message . this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals , a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years . this gives the show a original twist that you cannot often find in animated shows . the overall design is also something very different . at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design , and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach . i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show ( as he also drew that segment in the comic ) . if you are looking for a mind-twisting show , a show that takes on various subjects such as reality , suicide , spirituality , life , then this is something you should not miss . once you begin watching , you are probably going to watch it to the end . one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic , but this is not too annoying . the only question remains though , where is the dvd ? !",1,10
"only the antichrist could have been behind such a disaster . one only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the ""film"" ! this movie was so bad , it forced me to register with imdb , finally , just so i could trash it . what makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such great source material ! i have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts . it may seem insignificant , but i'd like to start with the score . as the proud owner of a music degree , i must register my indignation ! i was torn between laughter and dry heaves as i listened to what john scheffer did to goldsmith's brilliant score; it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes , and almost as inadvertently comedic . it was by far the most inappropriate score i've heard since , well , i really cannot think of a worse one . maybe jaws 4 ? as for the plot . . . i'm sorry . new age mysticism ? ? ? what ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy ? in those films ( more so in the first two than the third , but still ! ! ) the supernatural was for the most part implied , and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable . here we have crystals going black ( calling all skeksis and mystics ! ! ) and inverted crucifixes galore , even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle . gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche : in its place a boorish ""slap in the face"" of recycled clich and transparent incompetence . add to that a lead ""actress"" so unbelievably annoying that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent . never have i seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little stephanie ruined all in the family . other than that , i have no strong feelings on the subject ;- ) luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train-wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or , at the very most , a study in how not to make a film . viewer beware ! may induce vomiting if you are lucky .",0,1

"originally aired as an abc movie of the week . this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town . they are not allowed phone calls and nobody knows they are there . what follows is rape , torture , beatings , humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion . the tv version was ( for its time ) grim . no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down . the unrated version is even worse--there is plentiful nudity , the violence is extreme and , in one particularly disgusting sequence , we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard ""uses"" her . yuck ! there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink . you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you are supposed to enjoy it . the needlessly downbeat ending does not help . i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch . a sick , sleazy film . not recommended .",0,3
"in the year 2006 , ""in cold blood""-a riveting thriller from 1967-has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have . first , and most chillingly , is the fact that it is star , robert blake , was recently on trial for murdering his wife . second , the recent oscar winning biopic , ""capote"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author , truman capote . these two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience . as a stand alone film from it is era , ""in cold blood"" is top notch in every way . most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from conrad hall ( later of ""american beauty"" and ""road to perdition"" fame ) . many of the stills from this film of the kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography . combined with the cracker-jack direction from brooks and superb editing in the early scenes ( where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers ) , a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense ( even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events ) . it's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen . the film is also anchored nicely by robert blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo . the flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done . then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last ""confession"" so to speak . it's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting , superb writing , flawless direction , and haunting photography . i dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down robert blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears . the only thing hampering ""in cold blood"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end . the tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey .",1,9

"someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film . firstly , it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993 . the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80's . my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world . there is a plot . kind of . a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses . at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loner's favourite song is london bridge is falling down . why is this his favourite song ? because he is an idiot . we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity . it gets even stupider . the loner is the nostril picker . i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose . that clears up the title . he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls . and kill them . that's more or less it . the acting is universally appalling . every single performance in this movie sucks . in fact , i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie . it really is that terrible . the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker . the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down . man , i feel like an idiot even typing this . anyway , it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls . and not in a good way . there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top . it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded . i'm not even going to describe it . you'll know it when you hear it . and you will agree with me . there are some scenes of violence , sure . and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual . there is even an immortal bit of dialogue , that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton , where the nostril picker says to a prostitute , 'i've got the cash if you have got the gash' . lovely , i'm sure you will agree . utter nonsense .",0,1

"coinciding with the start of the baby boom , the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes . directed by h . c . potter and co-written by norman panama and melvin frank ( ""white christmas"" ) , this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well . of course , it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs cary grant , myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership . even though the film is sixty years old now , there is a timeless quality to the blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it . obviously , hollywood thinks so since it is been remade at least twice - first as a very physical tom hanks comedy , 1986's ""the money pit"" , and again last year with ice cube's ""are we done yet ? "" . one look at hgtv's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today . the plot begins with ad man jim blandings , his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath manhattan apartment . rather than pursue muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7 , 000 , jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move . with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole , the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair . however , the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one . this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first . costs rise with each new complication , tempers flare , and even a romantic triangle is imagined among , jim , muriel and bill . priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners . with his double takes and flawless line delivery , grant is infallible in this type of farce , and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters . in a role originally meant for irene dunne , myrna loy shows why she was hollywood's perfect wife . she does not get many of the funnier lines , but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own . watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette . as avuncular , pipe-smoking bill ( ""cole bill cole"" ) , melvyn douglas shows his natural , easy-going lan as grant's foil . smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well-digger mr . tesander , lurene tuttle as jim's officious assistant mary , and louise beavers as the blandings' lovable maid gussie . the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then-wife , actress betsy drake . a most appropriate 1949 cartoon , ""the house of tomorrow"" , is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house . the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant's film classics complete the extras .",1,8

"it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to albuquerque . gabby hayes ( juke , sounds like duke ) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general , with his girlfriend pearl being an exception . he then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of pearl , who is the town barber , no less , and who claims if everyone followed his example , she would be out of business . this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film . gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers , but is a definite plus to this one . it's too bad he was not in more of the better randoph scott westerns to help lighten up randy's usual iron-jawed demeanor . also on this stage are randy ( cole armin ) , his future wife ( cathrine craig , as celia wallace ) , whom he is getting acquainted with , and a little girl ( myrtle ) , to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of randy's wheelchair-bound uncle john armin ( george cleveland ) , who essentially runs the town . randy soon learns that his uncle , and by extension , himself , is not exactly popular among the town folk . he does , however , quickly form a useful friendship with gabby . after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor , celia wallace , and the associated murder , he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for celia and her brother ted ( russell hayden ) , instead of for uncle john . as his rival's prospects rise , uncle john decides to plant an informant ( barbara britton , as letty tyler ) in the wallace office , to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run . when this does not work , he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office , for which randy is blamed . unfortunately , when the fire was discovered , randy was in letty's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle john . myrtle and letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered . this puts him and letty in the dog house with celia ( his apparent beau ) and ted ( who hopes to woo letty ) . this news also ends uncle john's trust in letty as an informant , and he suggests she leave town . instead , she switches sides and tells the wallaces why randy was in her apartment . uncle john tries once again to sabotage their ore run , and when that fails , there is a general shootout in town . you can guess the results . the plot is well constructed and executed , with complicated relationships between the principles , and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome , with the sometimes aid of his associates . at least , randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice . uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination , but arrogantly trusted that a woman would not have the guts to carry out her threat . the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women , as well as little myrtle , much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival , as uncle john put it . it seems odd that barbara britton , the ""bad"" girl , gets top female billing over catherine craig , randy's love interest . barbara's on camera time was much more limited . those who grew up on the lassie tv series featuring george cleveland as ""gramps"" will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain . we may wonder if his wheelchair-bound status has a bearing on this persona . this leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild west . without apparent family to help support him ( except randy ) , he cannot afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town . on the other hand , from his conversations , he probably achieved his status as the town ""boss"" before becoming wheelchair-bound .",1,9
"so , neighbor was killing neighbor . reminds me of iraq . as i watched the american flag ( 50 stars in 1864 ? ) being dragged behind the horse , i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue does not upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of rights . i'm a southerner , and must have some historical memory . watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave , as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans ( his ethnic background ) being wagered at a poker game . . . . . was interesting . many twists in this movie . the wife , who is forced into her marriage , shows both lust and a strong will , characteristics we are not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles' . the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin , head of the copeland horse-thieving gang , inc . in mississippi , was hung about that time . bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside , armed . remind you of iraq ? and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background ? and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today . too bad we cannot use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we have just invaded and are occupying , fomenting civil war everywhere . that's mesopotamia , now called iraq , who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil . the wild-eyed killers in missouri , raiding lawrence , kansas could as easily be the insurgents we are fighting now with no success . another anomaly was the father's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school ""even before they erect a church . and for that reason , they will win .

"dreary . schlocky . just plain dreadful and awful . let's be honest , when you sit down to watch something called the double-d avenger you are not expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment . you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts . you do not get really either of these in the video . the story , as it consistent with most of these types , is inane : kitten natividad runs a local pub , finds out she has breast cancer , flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver , returns and fights , dressed as the double-d avenger , a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition . as stories go , i have seen a lot worse , but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous . the action sequences lack zip , drive , motivation , and are tissue thin . the acting is not even properly campy and the dialog is the pits . nothing , and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references . all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it , but they all fall way short . kitten , haji , and raven de la croix are all quite older ( still lovely in their own ways ) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be : older , campy caricatures of their former selves . instead , they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are ""starring"" in rather than their own abilities . there are some other lovely ladies , but you really do not see much of anything . pg -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this . the material , the actresses , and director are all tired , tiresome , and dated - and again - not funny ! it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this , and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun . the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me . not that he was good at all mind you , but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was . the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr . sci-fi himself , forrest j . ackerman , play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie . other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired , dreadful , trite pun !",0,2

"i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it . a group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada , run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn . only problem is , unless i miscounted , there is only one mutant on display , and he is not all that impressive . sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago . some gory but silly deaths help , but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief . the ending is predictable and has been done to death . no pun intended .",0,2

"i originally came across linda feferman's seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it . i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure . the movie stars jennifer connelly , almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind , as natalie becker . byron thames plays her best friend in the world , jeff moran . the film is definitely a milder , cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink's and some kind of wonderful's of the 1980's , which is exactly why it is so good . it's honest , not forced like those films , and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids . when natalie's dad leave home on a business trip , jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks . with support from natalie's friend , polly , played exquisitely by maddie corman , she lets him . but this movie is not about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with . the three leads are so natural and the script , surprisingly so honest , that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking . these characters really do care about each other . it's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre-teen adolescence .",1,8

"wow . . . i picked this up at the local wal-mart after reading online that it had been released early . i've been following this online for some time , and just had to buy the film . wow . . . i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing , or lack thereof . time and again , characters ( usually the narrator and whoever he is with ) are shown walking . . . and walking . . . and walking . i am not an editor , but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b . there is no need to show almost the entire journey ! wow . . . i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this . they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy , depending on what action was to be added at a later date . wow . . . why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me . even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes . one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of ( according to the end credits ) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities , including london . at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera . in one shot in london , there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother ( played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache ) . not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair . wow . . . why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me . it is a turkey , plain and simple . on the plus side ( at least for me ) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while .",0,1
"as horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap-shoot . sometimes we find a real gem , but many times we find that the film we have just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box . such is the case with five across the eyes ( a title i'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out ) . the story , or , at least what the *ahem* writers think passes for one , centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender-bender in a gas station parking lot . in fairness , it is an interesting idea . some of the best horrors have very simple story lines . it's in the execution of five across the eyes that this idea falls flat . the film tries to be a cross between the blair witch project with its shaky camera work and the texas chainsaw massacre in its bare-bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither . what we get instead are redundant scenes of chase , torture , release; chase torture , release , in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching , moaning , and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in-between chase sequences . the look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark , which , in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism . here it is merely annoying . the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard-pressed to find anything to sympathize with them . one character stops to get a first-aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed . another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like ""don't go out there , she will get you , if she gets you she will kill you and if she kill's you you are dead"" . it was an accolade from fangoria magazine and dreadcentral . com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out . talk about a fake orgasm ! perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section . i'm all for low-budget indie horror but this one takes the crap-cake . give five across the eyes ( or fate; get it ? ) a pass . razorfriendly gives fate 1 slash out of five /",0,2
"mark frechette stars as mark , a college radical leftist . mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot , and he flees all the way to the desert . he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport , and flies it himself . once out flying over the desert , mark spots a car from the air . a young woman named daria steps out , and sees mark circling in the plane . mark swoops the plane very low several times , causing daria to duck or get hit . when he lands , he becomes acquainted with daria , who is strangely charmed by mark's aerial highjinks . after engaging in soulful conversation for hours , mark and daria get naked , and make love in the sand . but with mark evading the law , they realize that he needs to keep running . so mark and daria's brief tryst is quite poignant , because it does not get to develop into a full-blown romance . zabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s . both films have a rambling , vague quality , along with complicated meanings and characters . frechette was as reckless in person , as his character was in this film . a few years after making zabriski point , frechette robbed a bank in real life . while serving his prison sentence , mark died an ignoble death . he was killed by a 150 lb . weight , which fell on him when he was weightlifting . the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography , and special visual effects . the incredible , slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion , were a stroke of genius . although not as ground-breaking a film as easy rider was , zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture . i recommend it , for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval , of the youth rebellion during the early 70s .",1,10

"another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s . with esther rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood , the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord ( black agent mr . bookman ) as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existing . the 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter , to their daughter who also aspired to attain success , this show was a perfect description of african-american life .",1,10
"first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american . i do not love country music but i can stomach it . i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats . i do not live in a trailer but i do eat tuna salad and own a home . what does that have to do with this comment ? a lot if you are one of those people who say only ""country"" people love this movie . this movie is loosely based on the ""they loved and lost"" premise . james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets . in an era of jerry springer and ""lets put it out there"" mentality , this film rings truer than ever . bud is ""coming of age"" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them . bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford . he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs . ( *this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked . marriage is a focus here that is often missed . early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married . the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man . it also brings into view the male ego with women and competition . ) bud is challenged and is excited when micky's puts in an electronic bull . sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start ""acting like it . "" the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they ( note this is giving some of the storyline away ) split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty . she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side . how anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me . john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition . he was believable and real . the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar . . still gives me goosebumps . mind you i am not a huge travolta fan , but come on , i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film . deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud , after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up . the supporting cast was incredible . wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy . madolyn smith-osborne , as buds mistress/girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the u . s . prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film . my biggest kudos's go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as bud's aunt and uncle . they seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role , they made the film so much bigger and lifelike . two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death . the dialog between them is touching . if you can watch this for what it is , a true american love story . then i recommend that you take it for what it is . . . a film before it is time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment . if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more . lastly , the music however dated , is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age .",1,9
"a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors , such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono . after 15 minutes of watching , your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters . this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience , it takes you in , it makes you a part of the story . . . costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built . it is definitely not very akira kurosawa , however it still gets a lot from the master , especially the stylistic story telling tells us we are in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance .",1,10

"bizarre tobe hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man ( brad dourif ) with the ability to set people on fire . this ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50's . they die of spontaneous human combustion and it seems that what sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend , lisa ( cynthia bain ) gives him to take for rough migraines . in actuality , lisa was told to manipulate sam into taking the pills by lew orlander ( william prince ) , pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child . lew has benevolent plans . . he sees sam as the first ""atomic man"" , a pure killing machine in human form . sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition . as the film goes , sam's blood is slowly growing toxic , green in color instead of red . it seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite . come to find out , lisa has sam's condition whose parents also dies from shc . dr . marsh ( jon cypher ) , someone who sam has known for quite some time as his physician , is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies , i'm guessing to increase their levels of flame . nina ( melinda dillon , sporting an accent that fades in and out ) was sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening . and , rachel ( dey young ) is sam's ex-wife who may be working against her former husband with lew and marsh to harm him and lisa . quite a strange little horror flick , filled with some pretty awful flame-effects . dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices . there's this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time . best scene is probably when director john landis , who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform sam to hang up because the radio program he is calling has sounded off for the night , becomes a victim of shc . the flick never quite works because it is so wildly uneven with an abrupt , ridiculous finale where sam offers to free lisa of her fire by taking it from her .",0,4

"this story is about the romantic triangle between a nth . african male prostitute , a french transsexual prostitute ( stephanie ) and a russian waiter who speaks no french and never seems to shave . as a film it is dull , dreary and depressing , shot either on foggy , overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors , where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence . and yes , i know , it is because the white balance was out . everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard , shabby and dirty . bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing . moles , greasy hair . yuk . bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex . and the story ? well , stephanie's mother is dying . all three characters go back to stephanie's home village where , through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors , we see a bit of stephanie's childhood as a boy called pierre . the mother dies . well . . . and that is about it , really . character development is kept to a minimum , as is the denouement of the story . i suppose the storyline is not linear ( it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs ) but really , after paying my seven euros i do not feel like having to construct the film myself : that is what the director takes my money for . to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty , so to speak , is asking way too much . this film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made , above all , from a desire to epater les bourgeois ( ie shock the straights ) . i can see how it was a shoo-in for the berlin film festival , and i can see why it got nowhere .",0,1
"manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( margaux hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( chris sarandon ) to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real-life sibling mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . while the central courtroom action holds the attention thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingway s lawyer the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly takes the musician s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . what the f*** ? ! ; she was clearly tied up what resistance could she realistically offer ? the second half of the film involving sarandon s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates irreversible ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel is rather contrived : mariel s character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister , but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! the climax in which sarandon gets his just desserts , with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante is , however , a crowd-pleaser in the style of death wish ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both films . it s worth noting how the two hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns ( this was the film debut of both ) : margaux s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here ) while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allen s manhattan ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real-life playboy centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosse s star 80 ( 1983 ) . with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages , margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996; chillingly , the hemingway family had a history of suicides notably the sisters grandfather , celebrated author ernest , who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .",0,4

"in keeping with disney's well-known practice of stealing . . i mean . . buying out known properties and bastardizing them , this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes . i grew up on the original cartoon tv series . any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie . not present is penny's cool computer book . also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief . new are a smooth talking gadget convertible ( the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car ) and an element of a typical , unrealistic hollywood romance . don't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their _ex_executives - do not see this movie .",0,1
"this film , was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that , unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it is quality while i grew up . this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children , it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well . the only drawback there is , is that one can not see past the bad' effects ( compared to the effects nowadays ) like one could when one was a child . i remembered nothing of those effects , of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film , when i was about eleven years old . who then watches effects ? one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides . in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century . coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film . there is comedy , romance and adventure all in one , which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern , it succeeds in not being dusty and old . all of that is mainly due to the great story , the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors . in that department sabu ( as abu ) and conrad veidt ( as jaffar ) stand out , providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part . great film and although an 'oldie' , definitely a goldie' . i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday . 8 out of 10",1,8
"oh my god . the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me . besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old . the plot , the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace . i am not usually this critical about any movie , cause every person has his/her style . but this movie , however , was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 . i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown , and i think it should stay like this , for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke . i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies , or even simply movies to stay far away from this one .",0,1
"there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war . they are ( in no particular order : apocalypse now , born on the fourth of july , platoon , and finally tigerland . all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it . tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war . the character of boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war , and the absurdity of it . this has been done in many war movies , but rarely in boot camp . also , this is a very complex character , whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie . the character of boz makes this movie so good . it is a shame it did not get a major release . it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles .",1,8
"this movie made me very angry . i wanted desperately to throttle the ""scientists"" and unseen film-makers during the course of it . very , very painful to sit through . sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way . the little good information on brain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t . the worst offenders were the crack-pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza . mr . dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he , on the other hand , is living on a higher plane . even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed , clumsy , superior , pretentious , preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them . i think that is what made me so angry , the fact that they have taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum . much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world . fittingly , the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clich ridden . i would refer people instead to bill bryson's excellent survey of science : ""a brief history of nearly everything . "" there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual , established science .",0,1
okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting . the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci-fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing .,0,2

"alexandr ""sascha"" luzhin ( john turturro ) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy-hosted tournament . his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life . natalia ( emily watson ) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother , vera ( geraldine james ) to scope out possible marriage partners . vera leans toward a handsome count but , astonishingly , natalia is more fascinated by sascha , whom she met on a walk . sascha , too , is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting . but , with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and , with other happenings in his past still causing problems , will he win the heart of natalia ? oh , and can he become the chess champion , also ? this is a lovely film , based on a novel by nabokov . the acting is amazing , with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy , awkward chess enthusiast . james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well . as for the look of the film , it could not be better . the scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety , the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause . yes , the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks , at times , making it a film not everyone will appreciate . then , too , the ending is bittersweet . however , if you love romance , period pieces , great acting , knockout scenery , or the fine art of motion picture creation , do not miss this one . you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms .",1,8
"heh , if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5 . 9 , will you call me crazy ? that's just to catch your attention . everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . dick tracy is one of those cannot be easily outdated , in terms of technology . the negative reviews mainly complained about dt's ""messed up"" story . but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and i had no problem following it . i did not see the comic books , yet i am not a huge us comic fan , but i appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances . maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . but , if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together , what would you expect . i had some scratches on my head , and cannot help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? the title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . madonna was more express-less than ""breathless"" in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . apparently he is bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . we can see a hybrid of scarface , michael corleone , adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh . and many thanks to make-ups . to me it is not bad at all . the surreal feeling really got me .",1,8
"""witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but , luckily enough , it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects , an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices . honestly the screenplay does not make one iota of sense , but who cares when linda blair ( with an exploded hairstyle ) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer ( who cannot seem to get laid ) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo , sewn-shut lips , upside down crucifixions , vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune . eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts . the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family ( with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are ) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex . they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady an aging actress or something who always dresses in black starts taking them out in various engrossing ways . everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window . anyway , the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""the evil dead"" . the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film . there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried .",0,4

"when i first got my n64 when i was five or six , i fell in love with it , and my first game was super mario 64 . and i loved it ! the graphics were great for it is time , a good plot , great courses and above all , the best music i heard in a nintendo game . i do not remember the plot completely , but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser , and mario has to rescue her . the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle . each had about five or six challnges to get the stars . there are secert parts of the castle , where you can get more stars . but of course , you have beat bowser . *i think there are three levels to beat bowser on* lets start with the characters . mario is the main character , and gets helpful advice from toad , so he is basically one of your only alliances . i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end . the main villain is bowser , and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba . the characters are really great . next , how about the graphics ? people say gameplay is more important then the graphics , and i agree completely . but with he great plot , there are great graphics . especially for it is time . i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do not compare to super mario . bright colors , great effects and awesome sound effects . i found the graphics in the water courses very very good . next to the bowser world ones , it has the best graphics in the game . now , the music . this is my favorite part of the game . growing up , when i played this at a young age , i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep . especially the music from jolly roger bay , which was peaceful and wonderful . there are others that are great too , especially in , once again , the worlds with bowser , are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites . this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer , and i love it . this game gets 10/10 or ***** ( 5 ) /***** ( 5 ) go play the game !",1,10
"eric rohmer's 'the lady and the duke' is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution . but it is a stilted affair , with its strange , painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone . most notably , this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie , and little of the chaos , poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted , but spoilt , aristocratic classes . the result is frequently dull , and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it is a disappointing film from an acclaimed director .",0,4
"director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre , creating masterpieces such as ""return of the living dead 3"" or ""bride of re-animator"" , but at the same time he has done awful movies such as ""faust : love for the damned"" or the mediocre ""progeny"" . he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon's films has been superb . ""the dentist"" , is one of his lesser works as director , but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience . it tells the story of dr . alan feinstone ( played superbly by corbin bernsen ) , a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife ( linda hoffman ) has an affair with the pool boy . this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so ""filthy"" . the premise is very well handled by yuzna , as he takes us on a ride following feinstone's day of revenge . what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective , we follow feinstone because he is the main character . we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day . yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie . most of the success of the premise is in bernsen's performance as feinstone . he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time , and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film . the rest of the cast is not as good , and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should . a notable exception is ken foree , as the detective trying to catch feinstone . while his part is quite small , he makes a great job with it . with a dentist as killer , gory scenes are expected , and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount . it's good to see that he does not go over-the-top with it as he usually do , and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film . it has the exact amount of gore that is expected , nothing less and nothing more . yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great . while this is not among yuzna's most well-known films , i would say that it is one of his best . sure , it is not classic material as his masterpieces , but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring . it is a low-budget simple film , but for what it is , i think it rocked . 7/10",1,7

"the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in 1990 ( the other being the more well-known grifters ) , after dark has all of thompson's hallmarks : dangerous women , the confidence game , and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being , or not as harmless . jason patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring ( director james foley uses raging bull-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story ) and the too-little-seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance . but bruce dern is the film's secret weapon : his sweet-talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his scenes . there is almost no comic relief in this film , so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void .",1,9

"though i've yet to review the movie in about two years , i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did . having loved the original little mermaid , and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be , i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel . disney , i've got a little message for you . if you do not have the original director and actors handy . . . you are just looking to get your butt whooped . in the sequel , our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter , melody . my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang . yes , i understand that disney is big on sing-and-dance numbers , but really , that is what made eric my favorite prince . he was calm , collected , and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun . and he did . not . sing . and then there is the villain . oh , how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen , terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world ? unfortunately , that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister , morgana . nothing was ever , ever said about morgana in the first movie; she just pops out of nowhere , trying to steal the baby . oh , how cute . the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident , decides to kidnap a month-old baby . gag me . other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her , morgana was just very unorthodox . the same plan as her sister , the same minions ( who , by the way , did not scare anyone . i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie , and she laughed hysterically . ) she had no purpose being in there; i'd like to have seen mom be the villain . i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there . king triton held none of the respect he would earned from me in the first movie , and do not even get me started on scuttle , sebastian and flounder . triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie , and in the second , it is almost like he is lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects . scuttle , once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle-hopper' ( yes , i'll admit it; i did call my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time after that ) . in this film , scuttle's all but forgotten . a supporting character even in the first , he at least added something to the movie . he was rich with a flavor the others did not have , and in the sequel , they all but stripped it from him entirely . sebastian was still the same , but twice as worrisome as before . disney , do not do that . don't even try to mess with our favorite crab . or our favorite little fat fish , who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children . he's fat , and he is bland , and he looks like he is going to flat line any second . the walrus and penguin were unneeded , and after a while , you just start to resent everyone . especially melody , who has no depth to her whatsoever . and one of these days , disney , i'm kicking out of my life . if i did not love your originals so much .",0,3
"i'm 14 years old and i love this cartoon . burt reynolds and dom deluise make a great pair . this movie is really funny and i love the songs . my favorite songs are ""you cannot keep a good dog down"" and that song about sharing , i think it is called ""what's mine is yours"" . this was the last movie with judith barsi , who played the voice of anne-marie . my favorite character is charlie but i find itchy's voice is so fun to hear . although some scenes i actually found scary , i still have a hard time watching the scene with charlie's dream , and carface scares the crap out of me . other characters like king gator i found really funny . the ending was adorable and was actually sad , made me cry a little . i give this movie 7/10 .",1,7

"priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be 'comedy' . that is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for . after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama , hera pheri and hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i cannot recollect for now . now with hideous films like dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture' . dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy . the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent . speaking of the acting , i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top ( if you compare them with the others in the movie ) , then came tusshar kapoor , then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above . the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting . the grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly . the plot was the same , seen before one . four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists . there is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb . and at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine . the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty . the worst thing about the movie is its length . after an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater . but being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie . the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place . if your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun . 3 out of 10 .",0,3
"bo derek might have had a career had she not let her late husband , john , take over as her director . it's a real shame , no really , with the right direction and the right part ( see ""10"" ) , bo was okay . she would not win any awards even at her best , but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone . but therein lay the problem , john was determined to ride the wave that bo created with her appearance in 10 , that of bo being the ""perfect 10 , "" ""the hottest woman in america , "" ""the sex symbol of the 1980s . "" problem is , in john's hands , this wave crashed with a resounding thud in only a few year's time . maybe he knew her limitations as an actress , perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body , not her acting skills . but it got old real quick . it did not help matters any that the films of john and bo derek are ( let us be honest ) really , really bad . and bad sums up their take on edgar rice burrough's literary icon , the lord of the jungle , tarzan of the apes . you know what is worst ? this film is boring ! make me laugh , make me cry , just do not bore me . not even bo's stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest , and that is what the film is of course built around . richard harris ( god bless his soul , he and bo were previously in orca btw ) hams it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and miles o'keefe makes a physically impressive tarzan . maybe he got the last laugh , after being hit with a ton of venom from the critics over this film , miles went on to a solid career as a b movie icon , in films that were not great art , but a million times more fun than this one . but other than that , it is bo's body , and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it . tarzan the ape man has nothing else . john derek was a truly dynamic actor , he was not a director . he should have stayed with his strength . this film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes . burrough's tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment ( who would not want to be as agile , strong and good looking as lord greystoke ? ) and fun ! you get none of that here . watch it , and you will have wasted 107 minutes of your life . on second thought , you may come away with a valuable lesson , how not to handle someone's movie career . bo derek is all right in my book though . she stood by john until his dying day , has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight . she has also proven that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be . if she could survive tarzan and bolero , she can survive anything . so come back bo , all is forgiven . and as an aside , is the steve strong who plays the bad guy the same steve strong who a brief pro wrestling career ?",0,1

"if mr cranky had rated this , i'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here . but as he has not , i'll have to give it a go myself . the only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that malcolm mcdowall's acting is excellent . however not even he can save this film from disaster . the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad '70's movies . even worse , both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was . it's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container/slave ship to nigeria . this ship's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb 12 or something . the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name . i honestly cannot find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie . i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - malcolm mcdowall in particular . i will not hold this against him as he is a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie . so , unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you are male and you are doctor is not doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you are really community minded , buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster .",0,1

"before i begin , i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved , including whittaker , who indeed deserves his nomination . it is highly entertaining , and . . . taken in the right context as a work of fiction , it is a very good movie . for that , i give it the two stars . however , rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere , i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth . i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character , dr . nicholas garrigan , is a complete invention of fiction . rather , it presents this character into a real historical setting , and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real , and what they are seeing is the truth . i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is , in a word , reprehensible . there can be no doubt that africa , along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering . hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film . but hollywood also has its eye toward making money . the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself , or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary . but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much . at the end of the day , they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself , and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming , ""see , we told you it was bad ! "" the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie . arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin , idi's second wife , whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity . in the film , we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse ( arms for legs and vice-versa ) . this is the director making sure you understand that amin is , as the gungans say , bom-bad ! but watching the documentary , we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth , which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true . so . . . what . . . they just make up these things ? why ? because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence , that is why ! they do not trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves . look , that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we do not need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that ! and this is just the tip of the iceberg . what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional . there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin's wing . as such , garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world . the producers seem to thing we will not be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it . ( ironically , even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor ! ) the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime , but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons , making several horrible mistakes , and then ""redeeming"" himself , even at the cost of three other innocent lives . honestly , i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs . amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment ! i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money . i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind , ron howard and akiva goldsman's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of john nash , which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just cannot get enough of . the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years , and viewers , who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves , buy these fake portraits hook , line , and sinker . look , i'm certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he was not . my point is , with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man , why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths ? why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films ? why can they not trust us to think for ourselves ! ? can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves ? i urge all who continue to watch hollywood's purportedly ""true"" movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself , and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth !",0,2
i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts . actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities . anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster . i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average . i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler .,0,1
"the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world . the show was hilarious to say the least . simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages . running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game . the action was mesmerizing , and cleverly set up . the characters were very original , each with a very different personality . but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters . each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed , but implied in subtext . hopefully , one day , there'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .",1,10
"as someone who has read the book , i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow . there are various reasons for this . firstly , emma is too unpleasant . yes , she has faults , and is not the easiest person to like - but the viewer should not downright start to despise her . secondly , mr knightly is miscast . his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen , and throw the mood of the whole affair ""off"" . thirdly , samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly ? harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she is going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene . fourthly , the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut . at the end , when emma decides she loves mr knightly , it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative has not been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film . fifthly , what was going on , exactly , with mrs elton's accent ? she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning , to all out american half-way through , and then back to english at the end . finally , this dragged at the end . the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly . this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony . all in all , a rather haphazard attempt . read the book or rent the paltrow version instead",0,4
"just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a ""bomb"" rating , a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night . i feared the worst knowing its reputation , and it was as god-awful as i'd anticipated . this is a mexican-made mess , dubbed into english , and produced by k . gordon murray . it's got terrible sets and effects , and features a rather frightening santa who does not operate at the north pole , but instead from a cloud in outer space , and who does not have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is . the opening sequence , where st . nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages , seems to go on forever , and with no story . obviously , this santa claus does not observe the child labor laws ! eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth , just to make little kids naughty and turn santa's christmas eve rounds into a nightmare . watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience , and it is bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever . oddly , the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film , which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on . this easily makes my personal list of the ""worst movie i've ever seen"" , but i'm sure that is nothing unique .",0,1
"the master blackmailer , based off of sir arthur conan doyle's short story , ""the adventure of charles augustus milverton , "" is the first feature length sherlock holmes story with jeremy brett that i have seen . the story is interesting and dark . the film has a somewhat dreary , sad feel to it , but it is quite entertaining ( with some especially funny scenes ) . *spoilers* sherlock holmes and dr . watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of england by publishing private letters that will , in one way or another , destroy their lives . they eventually find out that he is charles augustus milverton , an ""art dealer , "" after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up . our heroes must next help lady eva blackwell , who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off . the scene in which holmes and watson burglarize milverton's house are intense . although the film has an essentially happy ending , the tone is sad and regretful . outstanding performances by jeremy brett and edward hardwicke ( as usual ) , and robert hardy as the notorious villain ( most audiences probably recognize him today as cornelius fudge in harry potter ) , serena gordon as lady eva blackwell , norma west as lady swinstead and sophie thomson as agatha ( the scenes involving her and holmes are a riot ) . i give it a ***1/2 out ***** . my only complaint is that there was not enough inspector lestrade .

"aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie , i think i've watched every movie guy ritchie has directed . twice . needless to say , i'm a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why . this movie is a very different approach from ritchie , when you look at it comparatively with lock , stock . . . and snatch . revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he did not expect and a guided walk for redemption that he did not know he needed . along with seeing andr benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability , other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr . d/macha and mark strong playing sorter , the hit-man . after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner , macha , jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent . when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha , jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that is left him with three days to live . a team of loan sharks , however , have an answer for him and a ticket to life- only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them , all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself . along with having the air of death loom , and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money , jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him , which introduces sorter - a hit-man under macha's employ . the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co- convicts he spent time with in solitary may very-well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into . when faced with this reality though , zack ( vincent pastore ) and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary , having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake . the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons . the style of the movie is top-notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes . although a lot of nods at ritchie's previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue , the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre . it's also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should . the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and , true to ritchie fashion , they are all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone's affairs . i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i do not want to take too much away from it if you have not seen it yet . it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it is a great movie and it should be seen . if you are lucky and you have not seen the watered-down us release , see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take . i saw it with my crew around early-2006 and we are still talking about it with little things we have picked up on today . it has garnered its cult status , and it is well- deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit . standout line : ""fear or revere me , but please , think i'm special . we share an addiction . we're approval junkies .

"watched both parts twice . enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero . he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain . i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the ""lady in distress"" . alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces . she did not have the look of the woman of the 1800's . the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well . i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older . age is inevitable , but let us not hide from it . a man at 50+ can be much sexier ( and , patrick truly is sexy ) then a green youth , no matter how pretty . hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile .",1,8

"in war , inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq . if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton , kellogg , brown & root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusack's latest piece . cusack plays a corporate hit-man named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target . while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by hilary duff . we are introduced to hauser's past , which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him ( and played hilariously by joan cusack ) . while some moments are played suitably over the top , they are not always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise . all the principals turn in solid performances . duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image . tomei is funny but understated while the cusack's own nearly every scene they are in . to be fair , they are given good material . the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion . in fact , the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it is way to the expected conclusion . if you like your comedy broad and physical , there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie . on the other hand , if you like sly comedy and broad satire , this is for you .",1,7

"as in amelie , recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant , centered on a female finding her one true love . in this case , desperation leads to a convict , which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype . clever and surprising story in many ways , except that the female is there to support the male . for those of us that do not speak french , the subtitles are a little quick , but not unreasonable . the soundtrack , as seems to be increasingly the case with european films , is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations . nothing seems forced . visually , it reminds me of various urban horror movies . there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it .",1,8

"to me a matter of life and death is just that- simply the best film ever made . from beginning to end it oozes class . it is stimulating , thought provoking , a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples . the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly . the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy . no matter how many times i watch the film - and i have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me . it makes me smile , it makes me laugh , it makes me think , it makes me cry . it is as fresh today as it was in 1946 . if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film .",1,10

"stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive ( separate ) film careers before they were eventually teamed . for many of ollie's pre-stan films , he was billed on screen as babe hardy . . . and throughout his adult life , hardy was known to his friends as 'babe' . while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music-hall act for bernard delfont , hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname : early in his acting career , hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardy's plump cheeks ( the ones on his face ) and said 'nice baby ! ' hardy's workmates started crying him 'babe' , and the nickname stuck . although much of hardy's pre-laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west -- his teamwork with billy ruge ( who ? ) in a series of low-budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed . hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt : names which are unpleasant in their own right , but made worse because ruge ( although shorter than hardy ) is not especially a runt . seen here , hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel . . . but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache . 'one too many' , an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic , is direly unfunny . . . and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'that's my wife' , one of laurel and hardy's most hilarious films . plump ( hardy ) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady . runt ( ruge ) is the porter . plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john , whose dosh he expects to inherit . his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plump's wife and baby . there's only one problem : plump has not got a wife and baby . he's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man . now , of course , plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice . of course , the results are disastrous . it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny , but they are not . most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick , with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs . spoilers coming . vim director will louis ( who ? ) shows no instinct for camera framing : the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy , and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame . this could be funny if done on purpose , but it is merely inept . at one point in this bad comedy , an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress . 'surely they would not stoop that low for a laugh , ' i thought . but they do . runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as plump's progeny . somehow , plump acquires an infant's cot , but he still has not got a baby . with uncle john coming up the stairs , plump conscripts runt for babyhood . this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget , or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as chester conklin , but billy ruge is only slightly below average height . ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny , and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it . amazingly , he does ! the most notable aspect of 'one too many' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by madelyn saloshin , oliver hardy's first wife . the marriage was not a happy one , although hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurel's . only one thing in this movie impressed me . there is a very brief flashback sequence , with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty . in 1916 , there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks : the one shown here is done gracefully and simply . too bad this movie has no other merits . 'one too many' is definitely one film too many on oliver hardy's cv , and i'll rate this movie just one point out of 10 . laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately .",0,1
"put quite simply , this film is terrifying . it starts off simply , looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film . don't expect gore , or zombies . this is psychological , and just as he would also do in candyman , bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed . each time you watch this film , you realise more about what is happening , and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect . drawings have never been scarier .",1,10
"in order to stop her homosexual friend albert ( perry king ) from being deported back to belgium , stella ( meg foster ) decides to marry him . the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian . the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party , they fall into bed and then into love . later in the film after falling in love , stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing . what she finds will leave the viewer stunned . this is a great film , very original . perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here . very controversial upon its release in 1978 , the ""r"" rated film is now ""pg"" in this much more liberal time . recently released on dvd , the disc contains a ""making of"" segment on the special features and in it it is stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not ""real"" are mistaken . everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved !",1,10

"gosha's last great film of the 1960's . a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films , gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu ( of zatoichi fame ) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty . ""tenchu"" ( heavenly judgment ) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or ""traitors"" to the cause . katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride . anybody who questions the politician is labeled a ""traitor"" and becomes an assassination target . one of the best photographed films ever , many shots are incredible compositions of form , color and light . the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal . the blood becomes a part of the color palette gosha uses for his images . gorgeous and disturbing . while the personal story is simple to follow , the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it . the few drawbacks to the film are the music track , the length and katsu's occasional scenery chewing . he has a drunken scene that is way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk . downbeat but one of the great chambara films .",1,8
"bad actors , bad filming , choppy dialog , shallow characters , but then again it was a bad premise in the first place . basically , an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal . of course , the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house , cash a check for 1 , 000 , 000 dollars , and even foil three bumbling idiots , reminiscent of the three stooges . preston blake is an annoying , obnoxious , boy , who decides that , when written a blank check by a complete stranger , he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can . in other words , he wanders into a bank , hands a teller a check he makes in his printer , and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash . preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle , due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10-speed could not catch him , even when preston jumped a row of cars . of course , with every hokey adventure movie , there has to be hot heroine . in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston , and promises another date when he turns 17 . however , the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting , nor its sloppy dialog , such as ""the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it is butt and then pick up the fur"" . it was , rather , the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people . what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias ""macintosh"" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts . of course , the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston , who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face , then treat her to hamburgers , finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground . our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two , as they make their way to preston's limousine , complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap , 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on . overall : 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film . i do not see how it only has a 4 . 4/10 .",0,1

"this was awful . andie macdowell is a terrible actress . so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job . but then remember that turn in four weddings , equally as excruciating . another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages , and village greens . i mean that school , how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that ? the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat ( a nauseating british series set in the 60s ) . this film just could not make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships . if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked ( i say just ) . but those scenes just did not work with the tragedy in the second half . i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour . a final note- what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo ? not to mention anna chancellor . macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream .",0,2
"what's inexplicable ? firstly , the hatred towards this movie . it may not be the greatest movie of all time , but gimme a break , it got 11 oscars for a reason , it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason . it's a damn good movie . which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it . i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters . i've rewatched it on tv and video , and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen ( twice , or maybe three times , actually ) . but that might be it , the appeal of it . it's a movie , yes , capital m there , it is an epic , it is a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur . now , ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me , with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama . not that titanic has none of that . well , the acting was actually very good . the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times . but the reason titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride . i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind , or give me a visual thrill . this movie is not exactly dumb , but it is not cerebral at all . the visual thrills are simply means to an end , to fuel the emotions of the audience . i did not cry when bambi's mom died , i do not react to tearjerkers . but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million , an emotional rollercoaster that , if it were a regular one , would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl . and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it , and have a ready supply of cynicism , then you can thoroughly dislike this movie . but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit , if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt , you will enjoy it completely . and look at the top ten grossing films of all time . is a single one of them bad ? is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 ? no , not even the phantom menace . and this movie made 1 . 8 billion dollars worldwide . it cannot be bad . not possible . 10/10 . p . s . how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman ? spiderman was a fun movie , but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did . it simply was not anything all that special . no one will remember it in 50 years . but i am pretty sure titanic will be remembered .",1,10
"i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist . where the exorcist was subtle and creepy , stigmata was blunt , clumsy , and way too formulaic . this is one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen in a while , but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable . my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist , and my visit to the official web site increased that interest . the web site had many tales of ""actual"" stigmata throughout history . however , scene by scene , the movie is so obsessed by its quest for ""genuineness"" that it becomes comical at first , then outright hard to watch toward the end . i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would-be heroine cuts hair and , evidently , flirts with priests . the plot : a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ ( the stigmata ) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal . a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case . is frankie possessed by satan , or a vessel for jesus christ ? the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends .",0,3

"having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 , i came here to pan it -- but after reading the other comments , i have not the heart . clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age . well , let me not be a complete grinch; it might still work for some children -- if they are not too media-saturated and have not become visually over-sophisticated , e . g . from watching all of lotr and harry potter . but if you are an adult , stay miles away; you will not enjoy it . the good bits : barbara kellerman as the witch , especially in her early scenes with edmund , creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness . ( at the stone table she goes a bit over the top . ) michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s . perry as mr . tumnus also have the kind of polished , skillful acting we would expect from the very best bbc dramas . and the aslan costume works very well , amazingly well considering . they got the eyes just right . the bad bits : almost everything else , but two areas in particular . one , the casting . england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids . how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs ? they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well . peter has no gravitas or charisma ( and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings ) ; edmund is just whiny; and lucy . . . sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically , visibly , drastically wrong for this part that i cannot imagine how she got the job . two , the animal costumes . again , it appears that they worked for some kids . if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting , believable characters , they might be entranced by this film . but to a viewer with the sophistication of , say , a 12-year-old who is seen prisoner of azkaban ? when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree , there will be hoots of cruel , derisive laughter . the costumes just do not work -- i could not , and i think any adult or modern teen could not , suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver . the drawn animation later ( gryphons , etc . ) works better , is easier to take . so : ten stars for the very young and tender of soul; everyone else read , or re-read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination .",0,4

"comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth . arms and the man , proves that notion to be false . shaw's play is full of comedic drama , combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth . on one level , arms and the man is a successful , and somewhat unique , romantic comedy . the young , melodramatic , and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war; her fianc and her father are both military officers . she is shocked , one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier . she rescues him , knowing that she will have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever , and the soldier eventually leaves . of course , once the war is over , that soldier comes back , forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships . it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot . shaw manages to comment on class constructs , on the absurdity of war , and even on the nature of love . and , of course , he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot . there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing . arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw's best works . ""arms and the man"" is both an amusing and thought-provoking movie that retains its relevance even today , more than a century after it was first conceived . shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure . the play has flashing wit , buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms . a good example of shaw's dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis : ""i'm a professional soldier : i fight when i have to , and am very glad to get out of it when i have not to . you're only an amateur; you think fighting is an amusement"" . indeed as a swiss hotel-keeper's son , bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments . shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different . the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending . the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy . this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically . shaw's ""arms and the man"" should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war .",1,8

"king kong vs . godzilla ( 1963; which i recall having rated bomb ) had been my introduction to cult director honda's work; this one is not necessarily better it is just that i've learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare ! here , we actually get two kongs for the price of one : an ugly and dopey-looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse ! the simian creature lives on the island of mondo ( ! ) where it is shown fighting a couple of other monsters , and befriends a trio of humans . naturally , it falls for the blonde ( and bland ) heroine; in fact , more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the film's villainous mad genius called dr . who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire ! ! he kidnaps king kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the element x , which is embedded in the icy wastes of the north pole; apparently , the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart ( and , to ensure its full co-operation , who even captures its three 'companions' ) ! the female agent then has a change of heart , helps the heroes ( one of whom , typically , is a nondescript american ) and is killed by who . kong eventually escapes and makes it to tokyo , where it has a final showdown with the robot . the doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub which , on a request by kong's dreamgirl , is summarily trashed by the giant ape .",0,3
"the mystery here is why this delightful , small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti . lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations , it s rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and , unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre , such as the taste of others , it actually entertains .",1,8

"i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still cannot help rave about this movie . arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span . running man , predator , and total recall ( 1990 ) . all 3 are amazing . the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion . i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall . they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017 , but you cannot help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's . also the computer graphics of the ""the running man"" game show intro would not look like that in 2017 . nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic . not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's . i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he is given credit for . now i would not have elected him governor but that is california for you . buzzsaw , dynamo , fireball , subzero are fantastic ""stalkers"" as well and i find the producers do not try to overkill the fight scenes . when the stalker is dead . . . he is dead . it does not go on for 20 minutes each . the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they do not try and overplay it . i give this movie a 10/10 and that is coming from someone who does not enjoy a lot of movies these days . if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you would see in 2006 are not important or necessary .",1,10

"this movie is a riot . i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies . i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny . but this one is wall to wall great lines . i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in . the movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up . other than that it is a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations . i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you do not get all the jokes the first time around . you have to see it two or three times to get it all in . as far as the actual film goes , it could have used a better edit , it is choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that . all the characters are great . it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke . i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable . no victims in this movie . also , thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend . catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film . you just wish that women like her really existed . she is not a ""10"" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite . if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it . i assure you , the trailer does not do it justice . they do not give away all the good jokes . just some of the mediocre ones . oh and one more thing . i hope critics put this on their top ten list . many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they do not put it on their list . this means you ebert ! ! !",1,10
"as peckinpah did with straw dogs , and kubrick with a clockwork orange , director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance , arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s . burt reynolds , jon voight , ned beatty , and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls ""one big , dead lake . "" but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these ""city boys"" carousing through their woods . and the following day , continuing on down the river , beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted ( the film's infamous ""squeal ! "" sequence ) by two vicious mountain men ( bill mckinney , herbert ""cowboy"" coward ) . thus , what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism . james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book , and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker . often known for its ""squeal ! "" and ""dueling banjos"" sequences , deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal , with the four leading men superb in their roles , and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times . a must-see film for those willing to take a chance .",1,10
"i have seen dolemite and also ( avenging ) disco godfather , two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore . but this film , the human tornado ( aka dolemite 2 ) will always hold a special place in my heart . for sheer goofiness , lack of skill in film production , and absolute enthusiasm ( frankly a little too much ) , the human tornado cannot be topped . the opening scene sets the tone . our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman , when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason , and would not you know it ! the woman in bed with ol' dole is none other than the sheriff's wife . her cry when she sees him : ""he made me do it ! "" dolemite's cry : ""&$*@$ are you for real ? ? ? "" subtlety was never his strong point . highlights ? the cameo by a very young ernie hudson ( of ghostbusters fame ) , the continuity errors ( characters looking one way in one shot , and another in the next , dolemite's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act ) , and queen bee's demonic eyes in her first scene . but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself . did the man really think he looked cool in this movie ? i certainly do not know why , but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has . whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff , or barking orders to his gang in rhyme ( e . g : quick ! into the cave ! i have a plan to let that mother $*@ ( %& dig his own grave ! ) the man commits totally . certainly he goes overboard , nevermore so than any time he is doing kung fu . the climactic battle is filmed at high speed , but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth . i'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast . in any event , ""the matrix"" it is not . human tornado , much like the original dolemite , is an incompetent film of enormous proportions . but at least it is fun , and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort . just not that much . enjoy with my hearty recommendations .",0,4

"this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing . just because you have got an excellent ensemble cast does not mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp ! think about it--the film featured richard widmark , lauren bacall , charles boyer , gloria graham , lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film ! the basic premise of the film is not bad--a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients ! also , the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife ( widmark and graham ) had a lot of promise . however , the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo--with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film . in fact , it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of ""general hospital"" . subtle , this film am not ! ! realistic , this film am not ! ! while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script , but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors . for example , paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent--especially when playing gangsters in film noir movies . yet here , stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accent--it just did not work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional . also , charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place . seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarre . overall , this is a rather awful film . it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly is not very pretty . my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent . ps--in a case of art imitating life , oscar levant played one of the patients . in real life , the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions .",0,3
"i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful . if there are people who watch this piece and think that ""well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2"" , then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why is and 'how is as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live . what more can a propaganda movie aim for ? the part in which an american movie about the rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here , for instance . the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked . no one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata . besides , the level of excitement ( or , the level of disgust ) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda . the audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up . . . well done . in the movie , there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience . the movie is kind of history today , so no need to fuss much about it actually . however , in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation , a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred , violence , decivilization as well as the problems of integration . overall , fine trash .",0,4

"first , this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the ""wonderland"" dvd rental . the two movies included with the rental , ""wonderland"" and the johnny wadd documentary , totally obliterate the myth created by ""boogie nights"" . that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money , basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self-centered whores . this is amazingly similar to what the book ""wiseguy"" and the movie ""goodfellas"" did to ""the godfather"" fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore . now , what irritated me most while watching these movies , and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked ""boogie nights"" , is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be . ""dirk diggler"" in ""boogie nights"" is without a doubt john holmes , who unlike ""dirk diggler"" , had no redeeming quality . holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him , was totally consumed by his quest for self-gratification , and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on wonderland avenue in los angeles in 1981 . the movie lays bare the big lie that ""boogie nights"" was , and reinforces the linda lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry . this should be required viewing , both features on the ""wonderland"" dvd , for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie ""boogie nights"" .",1,10

"one question that must be asked immediately is : would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis ? the answer is : probably not . but , thankfully , they are ( or were ) the cousin and aunt of jackie . this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence ( one could hardly call it a life ) of edith b . beale , jr . , and her daughter edith bouvier beale ( edie ) , has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you do not want to look but you have to . big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton , new york , that is slowly decaying around them . the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle . magnificent oil painting lean against the wall ( with cat feces on the floor behind them ) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines . living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others . clothing is seems to be optional . edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head . as edith says ""edie is still beautiful at 56 .

'doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching . the only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of meryl streep , who no doubt deserved the oscar-nomination . though it was not one of her best performances , she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen . however , not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill . from the boring start , which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending , the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers . it was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film , which dragged on for too long , with too much talk and not enough action . furthermore , the other oscar-nominations were less than convincing . though philip seymour hoffman gave a decent performance , it was by no means oscar-worthy . ( especially since they completely left out performances such as will smith , in seven pounds ) . amy adams did not deserve the nomination . watching amy adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain . it would have made more sense to nominate her for a razzie , as i am sure she would have walked away victorious . viola davis gave a short but truthful performance , but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination . overall , i consider doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008 . it was a mess of a film with so much potential , and i do not recommend it . the only shining light in the film is meryl streep , who though gives a stunning , solid performance - does not even do enough to save this film . *** / 10 .",0,3

"better than the typical made-for-tv movie , invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting ( urich , lucci , cassidy , mccarthy , pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto , soleil moon-frye ) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot . urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles . kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live , the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy , maudlin denoument . 7/10",1,7
"this is one of those movies that is difficult to review without giving away the plot . suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on , beyond the initial superficial ""tom cruise screws around with multiple women"" plot . the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm , and all the cast are well suited to their parts : cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all - and then loses it all , diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover , cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist . the story involves elements of romance , morality , murder-mystery , suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip . i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what is going on . if you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense , and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution , then this is a must-see . 9/10",1,9

"most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about; a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11 , 2001 . what you probably will not know before seeing this film is this : how that would feel; what do you do with that; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day ? the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson , ( don cheadle ) and ex-college roommate charlie fineman , ( adam sandler ) solidifies and begins to take shape . characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact , stay with this story , and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate . real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates . the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by sandler , as layers of an onion one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined . it's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen . cheadle's alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle . always watchable , the ease that is apparent when cheadle's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills . alan's relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture , just as the situation would demand . fineman does not want friendship , nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet , the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie . it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlie's carefully sealed life . there is inherent danger in the process . the more alan nudges charlie to open up , going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst , ( liv tyler ) the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge . it's an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial . he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss . unfortunately , his grief is one thing he cannot deny . sandler withdraws so deeply into his character's pain during the story's unfolding that , by the time he meets his demons head-on , the viewer shares his pain almost equally . alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home-life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane . ( jada pinkett smith ) while tending to charlie's recovery , alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man . his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost . the theme is much like the fisher king; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss . like the fisher king , the story concludes with the traditional , there is someone for everyone theme . reign over me's lidia sinclair , ( played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king ) is donna remar , ( saffron burrows ) a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnson's , who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlie's borderline insanity . it's a good ending to the story , but the one element probably least likely to ring true . then again , maybe there really is someone for everyone . devorah macdonald vancouver , bc",1,7

"this movie is a muddled mish-mash of clich s from recent cinema . there are some promising ideas in there , but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film , what he ended up with was a confusing mess . lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he does not have much to work with . furthermore , the movie is largely devoid of scares ( although , in fairness , there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery ) . *mild spoilers* we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin , diabolical librarians , ghostly love interests , identity confusion , death by savage monkeys , oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers , sublimated homosexuality , and crime gang connections . the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent . perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover , the act itself is never directly portrayed . instead , director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary . *end spoilers* avoid this one . for an excellent psychological , ambiguous horror tale , check out the korean film a tale of two sisters ( 2003 ) .",0,1
"this film was hard to get a hold of , and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming . i mean , this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century : an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . with all of this built-in interest , how could anyone make such a lackluster , talk-laden flick of this true-life event . while williams is always interesting , the screenwriters assumed that the d . b . cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star , s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty , but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . shame on this film for even existing .",0,4

"there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas , so let us get that part out of the way . first of all , let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film . cat was . . . well , just awful . jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian , and fearlessly commits to over the top , outrageous characters . mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks . why , why , why mike myers ? ? the kids could care less , and the austin powers demographic is not going to spy this film . so , what was the studio thinking ? the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond . can we talk ? why a new york accent ? not entirely consistent with anything dr . seuss has ever written . myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick . i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said ""as long as you do not say fahklempt' , you can keep the accents . "" meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort , either with the costume , make-up , or dialogue . the jokes , what few there were , were crude and age inappropriate . when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera : ""dirty ho"" , everything but the rim shot was missing , and even that would not have helped . the same folks who created 'whoville' , clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat' . the sets and props were very appealing , giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing , direction , and myers . there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston . dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr . seuss classic , and stayed true to the genre . call the spca . this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again . please , please , no sequel .",0,1

"i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard"" $400 for a fully furnished apartment"" so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more . luckily , i could rewind to the beginning ( dvr buffer ) and hit the record button to watch it entirely . ( cinemax uncut and in hd no less ! ) aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events , this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . pretty creepy and progressive at times : beverly d'angelo's character masturbates in front of alison parker , played adroitly by cristina raines , parker stabs , in very gory fashion , her father , an explicit menage a trios scene . ( do not let the kids watch ) the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes ( polyester suits and tacky ascots ) and decor , bad hair , over bloated music score , and familiar looking cinematography . the cast is excellent , take a second on this film's home page to check it out . it was a surprise to see christopher walken , jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young . sylvia miles- always wonderfully creepy ! enjoy !",1,8
"one of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade . throughout the five hours , ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day british society . david morrisey is , as usual , brilliant . at first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine , but then proving to be intelligent and caring , as he works with her in uncovering the truth . i have never seen surrane jones before . i believe she comes from the world of television soaps . her performance was magnificent , as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother . i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama , but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters . it is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama , whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves .",1,10

"vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 , coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career . i am not too keen in romantic movies these days , because i see them as ""old wine in a new bottle"" and so predictable . however , i have watched this movie three times now . . . and believe me it is an awesome movie . vivah goes back to the traditional route , displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage . the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do ( or would do ) when it comes to marriage . in that sense sooraj r . barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie . several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately : * when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride ( amrita rao ) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family . the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene . * the first conversation between shahid and amrita , when he comes to see her - i . e . a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation . also amrita's naive nature , limited eye-contact , shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions . * the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle ( alok nath ) when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece . clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way . the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her . she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie , and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly . shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too . he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r . barjatya film . in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple , without a shadow of doubt . other characters - alok nath ( excellent ) , anupam kher ( brilliant ) , mohan joshi ( very good ) . on the whole , vivah delivers what it promised , a well made and realistic story of two families . the movie has top-notch performances , excellent story and great music to suit the film , as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r . barjatya . it's a must see !",1,10

"what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make , running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate . the whole production feels cheap and shabby , and it is not helped by a ""big name"" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he is given in a credible fashion . at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they are clearly watching the clock here . bang out the scenes , get the pay cheque , go home , and try to forget all about it . it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers , it is just utterly anodyne , and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras . the pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts , which makes it feel irrelevant . maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored , and for being a fun game of ""spot the kiwi bit parters""; most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena : warrior princess . the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break .",0,3
"funny . sad . charming . these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful , simple film . it is rare that a movie truly moves me , but ""shall we dance ?

"as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour . however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw , who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she is in . connery is fine as is fishbourne , but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality . and the ending is simply bizarre . the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner , so to compensate they added an overloud ""dramatic"" score . every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration , to the point where it becomes laughable . if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see , otherwise skip it .",0,4
"i have recently seen this production on dvd . it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered . at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then . ( i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then ) but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been . i am a bit of a ""jane eyre"" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one . i have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on . reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly . all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way , some even leave out the ""rivers"" family and their connection to jane altogether . i also think this is the only production to include the ""gypsy"" scene done correctly . the casting is perfect , zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book ""small plain and dark"" and i disagree that she looked too old . timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester , portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off ! i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time , like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted , his expression is fantastically frightening . but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another . a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable . oh to be loved by a man like that ! there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however , like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things ( i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks ) . finally if you never see another production of jane eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection !",1,10

"i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too , if you are gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f/x to back it up . also do not get a bunch of z list actors to play in it . another thing , just about all of us have seen jurassic park , so do not blatantly copy it . all in all this movie sucked , f/x sucked , acting sucked , story unoriginal . let's talk about the acting for just a second , the carradine guy who is career peaked in 1984 when he did ""revenge of the nerds"" ( which was actually a great comedy ) . he's not exactly z list , he can act . he just should have said no to this s--t bag . he should have did what mark hamill did after ""return of the jedi"" and go quietly into the night . he made his mark as a ""nerd"" and that should have been that . i understand he has bills to pay , but that hardly excuses this s--t bag . have i called this movie that yet ? o . k . i just wanted to be sure . if i sound a little hostile , i apologize . i just wasted 2hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel , and i feel cheated . i'll close on that note . thank you for your time .",0,1

"on september 11th , 2001 , millions were killed; but 2 , 819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner . they were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings , but more importantly , people . this film takes an in-depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives . charlie fineman ( played by adam sandler ) , a former dentist living in new york , loses his wife and three children on september 11th as they were on their way to los angeles . emotionally annihilated by the events , he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life; including his in-laws and his best friend ( played , respectively , by robert klein , melinda dillon , and mike bender ) . he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life . this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson ( played by don cheadle ) who fineman does not seem to remember . the two begin to catch up , but fineman believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help . slowly , but surely , fineman regains his trust for johnson . while all this is happening , alan johnson's life is going down the wrong path . he is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice . one day , a patient of his named donna remar ( played by saffron burrows ) attempts to make a move on him , telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him . this is an unwelcome surprise to dr . johnson since he is a married man with two children . as he is coming home from work on a particular workday , he sees his old friend ( fineman ) and tries to flag him down . he is unsuccessful , but he gets another opportunity and persuades fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up , despite the fact that fineman does not know who he is . one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif . one of fineman's physiological crutches is music , particularly springsteen and other classic rock artists . when fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant , he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music . when the film was over , i had me thinking : how would i cope with the loss of my family ? how would i deal with such a tragic events . it's something we do not really think about too often . we always think they will be there and we often take them for granted , whether we intend to or not . we usually realize how important they are when it is too late; and a blow like that can destroy someone physically , emotionally , and physiologically . i really do not know how i would be able to deal with something like that . would i face the problem head on , cope , and move on with my life or would i just put my headphones on and block the world ?",1,8
"i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment . disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful , the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and , being a fan ( sounds pervy , i'm not ! ) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's , i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out . my conclusion : let us stick to the classics ! yes , the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat , the actors unconvincing . even dawson is empty . some would say that it is a right depiction of the college world in the us , that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial . just like the scene where dawson gets raped : it seriously lacks intensity ! i was not expecting anything 'irreversible'-style but still , are not we suppose to feel compassion for her ? i did not . not for a minute , she was so lame all the way ;- ) and i read that the photography was impressive . well , it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either . i must admit that the screening at the festival was not so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie , i could not help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again . lol . more seriously , the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me' . . . the crude red and blue lighting , the heavy bass music , the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere . . . no , i just could not get into this movie . too bad .",0,3
"i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because , frankly , i love the guy , even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie ( long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick ) . it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot ( but then most movies these days are not exactly original ) , but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband , martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter , and mitzi kapture does a good job , if that was her goal , of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like . nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis . however , too much of the plot takes place off-screen -- like motivation , prior behaviors , good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ( i . e . , me ) . the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the ""but what about . . . "" category , and overall , i cannot say that i cared much about any of the characters . that being said , it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and i still like nick .",1,7
"every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one . this also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies , that not a lot of people have ever heard of . there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out . ""panic in the streets"" is another movie like that that springs to the mind . both are movies that are not really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources . i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie . it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed . like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it is characters you are in for a real treat with this movie . the movie has a really great story that involves espionage , though the movie does not start of like that . it begins as this typical crime-thriller with a touch of film-noir to it . but ""pickup on south street"" just is not really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on . it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch . i also really liked the characters within this movie . none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses . really humane . it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter , who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for . it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen . even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great , original , special little movie that deserves to be seen by more ! 10/10",1,10

"it's a testament to gosha's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . and it is a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa ) , that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them . shintaro katsu is okada izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi , played by another genre stalwart , tatsuya nakadai . the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate . the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate , but it is not essential by any means . the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well . as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60's ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . and speaking of story , hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada . as most chambara protagonists , izo finds himself in a moral double-bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self-advancement . lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan . the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a ""nameless"" drifter without past or future , torazo the vagrant . although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo's mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self-dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . hitokiri ends ( which i will not reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death .",1,9

"dieter bohlen , germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like ""you're my heart , you are my soul"" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer . the result was a funny book about his life . well , more or less a fuzzy image of it . he did not deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself . no word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital . however it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the german version of ""american idol"" - especially his unforgettable comments . this should be the end of the story - really . in the hype of the mentioned ""idol"" tv show called ""deutschland sucht den superstar"" ( abbreviated dsds ) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book . the result is ""dieter - der film"" i have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely . none of the gags really hits the point . naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although verona's voice should have done that more . obvious , childish , predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes . the content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on bohlen's sloppy idealized memory . they could have used this freedom to do almost everything . it was supposed to be a satire , but they failed . the story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all . it's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release . the probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of dsds turned out to be a mediocre success . with the ""friendly"" help of germany's biggest yellow press newspaper ""bild"" and the desperate situation for the tv station rtl to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show ""wetten dass . . . ?

"this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about ""gigli"" , that ben and jen flop earlier this summer . ""the order"" was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes , rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film , appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot . now , i'm a heath ledger fan ( ""10 things i hate about you"" , ""a knight's tale"" and particularly his supporting role in ""monster's ball"" ) , but my man needs to find himself a better agent . keep accepting scripts like ""the order"" and ""four feathers"" and he is going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion . here are the problems i had with the film . firstly , the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with , well , much of anything . plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope , while mildly interesting , did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters . the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best . secondly , please do not insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory . we had manufactured angst , manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of ""matrix reloaded"" with skull-numbing techno music . rather than developing character , these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were , a half-hearted attempt at putting popcorn-chewing adolescents in the seats . thirdly , and most importantly , this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept . we have scandal , we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play . why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background ? we learn a little about alex , but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days , a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past . and alex is the most developed , if you can call it that , character in the entire film . as the cliche goes nowadays , if you are going to see one movie this year , make sure it is not this one . there's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair . the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i'm rather fond of . 1 out of 10 . i'm disappointed . file this one firmly under -had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing- . heath my man , go back to monster's ball-like cameos . they really suit you .",0,1

"zombi 3 has an interesting history in it is making . firstly , it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 , with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a . romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi . confusing enough ? basically , none of the films have anything to do with one another , but who cares when they make money . i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out . bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time . zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare . scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines , terrorists steal it unleashing a plague , and zombie run amok . the scientists want to create an antidote , while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice . there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet . overall , i actually liked this film . i heard horrible things , but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable . the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution , corrupted military , man playing god , etc . i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film , but it veered off in a weird direction , presumably when mattei came on board . besides ripping off other zombie flicks , this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies . you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with , ""when you see the men in white suits & gas masks , run to them for help . "" this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies . later , they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular , uncontaminated people is killed by mistake . the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner . how is it cool ? let me count the ways 1 . zombie birth 2 . flying zombie head 3 . zombie birds . 4 . zombie with no legs swimming in a pool . my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station . he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl . favorite quote when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie , the scientists asks , ""don't you think that once the ash is in the air , it will fall to the ground , and contaminate everything ? "" to which the sargeant boldly replies , ""now you are talking science fiction . "" he also continues to mention the ""science fiction"" told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies . extras : gallery , trailers , and interviews , most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes , yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details . bottom line : a must see for zombie and fulci fans . rating : 7/10 molly celaschi www . horroryearbook . com myspace . com/horroryearbook",1,7

"how this has not become a cult film i do not know . i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy ! ""runaway car"" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller , but taking the quality of acting ( good god it is bad ) , the storyline , the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh . and laugh you will . films are made to entertain us , and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth . this film is the pinnacle in entertainment , i laughed from beginning to end . at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked , it really is that funny at some points . when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook did not rip the car roof to pieces , i was laughing hysterically . but when the baby starting swinging around in the air , nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree , tears were running down my face . it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's ""like a prayer"" video . he seems to get everywhere .",1,10
"one of the ten best comedies ever this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings . keaton's comedies are _innerly , harmoniously , intelligently ordered , thought . wonderfully amusing , deliberately delightful and inventive , three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one . a threefold love story will enchant the viewers; i want to bring here this approach keaton's comedy is like lang's destiny upside down or rebours . again a couple traverses the waters of time and of epochs in the stone age , in rome and in keaton's times in a mohammedan country , in renaissance italy and in china . the same device works in the both movies one , a grim , eerie melodrama; --the other , a light , virtuously paced comedy . at keaton it is essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with lang . the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice . i have found three ages well written and smart , without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very popeye like the babe is a piece of furniture , the only protagonists are the two male rivals keaton and beery . keaton's movie is simply enormously likable , and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious fun yet it is not , but it is grand fun , large fun , ample fun . and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis .",1,9

"tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei' , a novel that was put on the screen twice ( 'spoorloos' and 'the vanishing' ) . one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot' , a psychological thriller about two totally different men , egon and axel , who meet at a youth camp and , surprising enough , become friends for dear life . egon is a quiet , somewhat dull person , who spends his time studying and writing geography books . axel , on the other hand , is a charismatic 'party-animal' , a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . from the moment they meet , axel has a strong influence on egon , while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything ( such as reading thick books like egon ) ; ultimately , egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself , which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country . after having read the book last year , i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . in my opinion , the book suffers especially from the complex structure . while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people , the plot becomes more of a puzzle : the many episodes are not presented chronologically , so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . because of this , the story feels surprisingly remote : you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her . another complaint was the fact that the main characters , egon and axel , are a little stereotypical . egon is 'the' dull intellectual , while axel is his exact opposite . in real life , such one-dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films , they always seem to be there , taking away a lot of credibility . despite all this , the film was a pleasant surprise , being much better than the book . the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography , humour and acting : fedja van huet ( egon ) is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting ( which is , in my opinion , the highest an actor can achieve ) . the drawbacks of the film , however , are the same as the book's : mainly because the characters are one-dimensional , they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . guess who wrote the script ? indeed , krabbe himself . it is obvious that this talented director ( that is what the movie makes clear anyway ) is hampered by a deficient screenplay . perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book . 7/10",1,7

"the ogre does not seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 , and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'demons 3' in order to help it sell better . well , the film is directed by lamberto bava; the man behind the first two demons films , and ogres and demons are somewhat alike ( in that they are both 'monsters' anyway ) . . . but other than that , this film has no connections to the other two films . it is , however , rather good ! italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films , and while it is not completely obvious; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser . the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy . she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement . it's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return . . . and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there is a murderous ogre living in the basement . the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv , so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; but for what it is , this is certainly a very decent horror film . lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well . the central setting , a large castle , makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times; such as the inferno-style pool scene . the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange ( particularly between the husband and wife ) . there's not a great deal of bloodshed , but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects . the ogre itself looks really silly and it is a good job that we do not get to see it very often . we do boil down to a fitting , if highly predictable , ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended .",1,7
"as the jacket proclaims , this film is ""gorgeously shot and masterfully edited , "" and , yes , it is mesmerizingly beautiful . the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity . and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in--or in the words of matthew arnold from ""dover beach"" : listen ! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back , and fling , at their return , up the high strand , begin , and cease , and then again begin , with tremulous cadence slow , and bring the eternal note of sadness in . at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that ""words do their job , but what i'm doing here says a lot more . "" as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates , is indeed something more than mere words can say . at another point he remarks on ""what is here to stay . . . and what is not . "" that is his theme . i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral . the idea was , that by emphasizing how short-lived are even the mightiest works of humans , a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed . perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression . he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it , or places it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality . both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it . and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural . thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity , but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along . this is art as art should be , akin to the spiritual . in a sense goldsworthy's work is an inarticulated understanding . it is an experience purely of time and form . in a sense his work ""answers"" shelley's famous poem ""ozymandias"" by saying , even as the tide washes the work away , and even as the river dissipates the expression , even so the art lives on because of our experience of it . similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out , and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished , they are given to the wind , so that we might know that all is flux . yet , in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos . goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer ( of necessity i would say ) and all his works , even the unsuccessful ones , he tells us , are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not . this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed . it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual .",1,10

"some time in the late 19th century , somewhere in the american west , several cowboys in need of money go on a buffalo hunt . the group's leader believes that buffaloes are too numerous for the hunting to have any impact , but the more experienced hunter has seen how quickly the population can collapse , and he is not so sure . featuring buffalo herds living in south dakota and showing film of actual hunting ( the movie's introduction explains it as necessary thinning of the herd ) , the movie does an excellent job of presenting us with the plight of the buffalo and its effect on native americans without ever getting preachy about it . the real story , however , is about the dysfunctional family which is created by the small group formed to do the hunting . the father figure is charlie , a violent man with a short fuse . sandy , his ""brother"" , is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle . a half-indian boy , who hates the fact that he looks entirely caucasian , takes the role of adopted son . the grandfather ( and moral compass ) is an alcoholic buffalo skinner; charlie's ""wife"" is an indian woman whose companions he killed after they stole his horses . charlie is clearly the most interesting figure . he is mean and insulting towards everyone around him , yet at the same time he knows that they are the only family and friends that he has . he expects the abducted indian women to hate him , then accept him , but he does not know how to react when she refuses to do either . he's the one who put the family together in the first place , but he is also the one who is fated to ultimately destroy it . this is all very similar to the classic ""red river"" , which also features a family of sorts being torn apart by the increasingly violent and alienated father figure . as one might expect , this movie suffers by comparison . the plot is not as focused on developing the characters and family dynamics , and the direction fails to keep all of the scenes working towards this common goal . charlie is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family . on the positive side , however , the message surrounding the buffalo slaughter adds an extra dimension to the film and its conclusion is far superior to the hollywood ending which was tacked on to the end of ""red river"" . as a result , ""the last hunt"" is an interesting and entertaining film , very well made , but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a classic .",1,7

"i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it . done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this ( and larry's not bad either ) . moe's character is a straight part ( mostly ) and this movie would be better named ""the curley and larry movie"" . not that any of the stooges movies were very good ( in my opinion ) , but as one commenter here said , how sad it is that this movie had real potential . the casting was good , it was well directed , filmed , and edited , but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers ( which i guess were good back then ) thrown in . the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash ( which is subject to debate ) is to wait for curley/larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it .",0,2
just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour . i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end . there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone . it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i do not suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error . the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet ( hood ) and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on . it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was not going to be lowered and then it was . i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it was not that bad ! ! ! !,1,10
"hines and goforth , the perpetrators of this crime , begin on the wrong foot first step , by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously . that simply is not true . wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment , and his main concern was that victorian self-satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad . two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer ( i was reminded of fay wray in the original king kong ) , rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of 'victorianisms' uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek . all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished , the warner bros . cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job . ( gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons , i expected them to float away any minute . ) think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics . worse yet is the loss of theme , which robs the film of any reason to exist . although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era , they utterly miss the uncanny way wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war - a fact not unnoticed by wells himself , who , after the war , reworked the theme in the shape of things to come . without any theme , all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons , when they are not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student's rewrite of macbeth . really , this is the worst , most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon ""fantastic planet"" thirty years ago . that film was so pretentiously dull , my friend and i and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half-way through , and sat near the screen playing cards , using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness , as far as any of us could tell . but i already have electric lighting in my apartment , so i did not need this put-down of wells for anything . do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can ( do not pay a cent ) and burn each and every one of them . god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose .",0,1
"so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills : natica jackson . or power , passion , murder as it is called in holland . when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality . unfortunately , it did not . 1 ) the plot of the film is really confusing . there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film . only they have nothing in common . throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me . but it still has not . 2 ) the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson . well it is , sometimes . like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest . so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice . to conclude my story , i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs , on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it . by doing this you will not waste 90 minutes of your life , as i did .",0,2
"vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel , however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android ( kris kristofferson ) and a warrior woman ( kathly long ) as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels ( who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie ) of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie , the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets . no , do not get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg . strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren , however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it . however despite the disastrous casting , kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie . he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long . ( and kristofferson is playing a robot ) despite the miscasting , kristofferson provides the few moments of interest . lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure . you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper . ( this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack ) worst of all it ends in a what if sequel , thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event . * out of 4- ( bad )",0,2
"this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life . to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution , and not just gay as a descriptor . or is it still used that way today ? i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 . it was released in 1993 , so it is been around . i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man's love for another over a 20 some odd year period . a love expressed in ways that only true love can be . there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain , along with scenes of joy and pleasure . there are scenes of life as a homo-sexual and life as a gay . the film itself was a work of love , and i believe it to be a diamond . at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids . as i write this , i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set . the advances in medical , political , and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set ( some 15 years ago ) are amazing . however , obviously , in the case of the disease of aids itself , we are not done yet . heck i guess we are not done on all fronts . anyway , it is just a pretty darn good documentary . i'd encourage anyone that feels that they do not quite understand gay life , gay issues , or the devastation of aids to watch this film .",1,8
"richard brooks' the last hunt was a film star stewart granger could not even stand to hear mentioned he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years but then the director did run off with his wife , so it is understandable . for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s , and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment . in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann's westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way . here granger's legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but , after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice , he is dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor's callous and proudly racist gunslinger , justifying it on the grounds that ""i've already got the guilty conscience . i might as well have the money as well . "" raised by indians , he is fully aware of the damage he is doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction , and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self-loathing as taylor is with hate . when the two men fall out over debra paget's squaw the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills and a white buffalo hide that is priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons , a showdown becomes inevitable , though the outcome certainly is not . taylor's is certainly ironic casting it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline . his hair color may not convince but his performance does , a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he does not wear a gun , the gun wears him . granger's accent is not always convincing , but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold , trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends . russ tamblyn's halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan's one-legged old-timer also give as good as they get , but the real star is the script : tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short . the new french dvd is extras-free but does boast a 2 . 35 : 1 transfer with an english soundtrack .",1,8
"i've seen this film in avant-premiere at imagina festival in monaco . i saw the first trailer four years ago , and from this moment , i was waiting to see the final result . i have not been disappointed . it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render . clearly inspired by some comic books , such as the ones from f . miller . in this optic , it goes one step further than the excellent ""sin city"" adaptation from r . rodriguez . this time , ( almost ) no grey or any middle color , but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film . ( cannot wait for scanner darkly ) the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements , such as direction or plot . the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium , and that is a really good surprise . the futuristic story ( paris 2053 ) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end . despite a classic base plot ( an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations ) the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes ( genetics , absolute power of certain firms . . . ) gives this movie a great interest . despite it is an animated film , this one is obviously not made for children . you will not find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral , only the cold reality . it is far closer to a good film noir . i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film : we still feel the well known paris , but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism . nevertheless , i regret a few mistakes . the montage is sometimes a bit flat , one or two very clich slow motion effects and some poor dialogs . even though the technical is excellent , it shows its limits in some romantic sequences ( a bit like ""final fantasy"" did ) . those little things makes it a 7/10 . altogether , it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can . the director , christian volckman , knows how not to fall into potential traps ( luckyly , they did not ask john woo to do the job ! ) . to conclude , it is a film with blasting visuals , an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction . watch it if you can ! please excuse me for the spelling mistakes .",1,7

"horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre-lover to watch a film , and , even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci-fi/horror gem . while lambert hillyer's ""the invisible ray"" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff ( ""frankenstein , ""bride of frankenstein"" , ""the mummy"" , . . . ) or lugosi ( ""white zombie"" , ""island of the lost souls"" , ""dracula"" , . . . ) , or both ( ""the black cat"" , ""the raven"" , . . . ) , this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing . compared to other universal horror pictures , the storyline seems a bit silly , but in a delightful manner . karloff and lugosi , of course , shine as always , and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography . karloff plays dr . janos rukh , a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope , and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago . stunned by rukh's invention , the celebrated french scientist dr . felix benet ( bela lugosi ) , invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor . in africa , rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike . . . it is somewhat odd that karloff , who was in fact british , plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi , who was hungarian , plays a french scientist , but they are both excellent as usual . as far as i am concerned , these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory , and i am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the horror genre , and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre . by the way , this is one of the few films , if not the only one , in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff . frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife . the rest of the performances are also good , if not particularly worth mentioning . other than the casting of karloff and lugosi , the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography , as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline . my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi , and for his role to have a bit more significance . he is fantastic as always , but his role could have been bigger , and more sinister . otherwise , ""the invisible ray"" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror/sci-fi cinema , and a must-see for all my fellow lugosi/karloff fans .",1,7

"this is a baffling film . the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits . greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini's film ""8 1/2"" but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema , greenaway is not . he has none of the maestro's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity . he is pretentious , the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each , as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds , not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored . as for the women , only two can be described as lookers , palmira , played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal . the rest ooze with ordinariness . both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy . greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness . the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money . relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction . there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film , indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant : the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son , philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere . the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child , she in fact , gets pregnant twice , the first foetus being aborted and the second time , she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book . both men having sex with a woman who has no legs , ( the half woman in the title ) . the beastiality that exists between beryl , played by amanda plummer , with a pig named hortense . father and son sharing women between them . women enjoying being beaten sexually . the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife . mercifully , none of these scenes are shown sexually , only hinted at . the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes . what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it , showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men . greenaway's directorial style is pretentious , it is a triumph of style over substance , a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense . greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships .",0,3

"maslin beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of adelaide , on the fleurieu peninsula , in south australia . it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location . maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy . this could be slightly misleading , as it is not a 'hilarious' film , nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense , but it does have light-hearted moments . much as life itself , there are also moments of sadness too . it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above , and nudity runs throughout the length of film . the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal , and concentrate on the plot , not the copious amount of flesh . simon and marcie ( michael allen and eliza lovell ) arrive by car at a beach-side car park . they take their belongings to the beach , and while they are walking , a voice-over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is . the rest of the film is an exploration of this , framed by one complete day at the beach . the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life , but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes . when they arrive at the beach , both simon and marcie appear bored with each other . marcie sees them as a 'romeo and juliet' romantic couple . simon is just bored with it all . next , we are introduced to gail ( bonnie-jaye lawrence ) , paula ( zara collins ) and jenny ( jennifer ross ) . they are walking down the beach together discussing gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man , aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother . however , there are many more interesting people on the beach , not all of them 'attractive' and young ( part of the realism of this film ) . to service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent , short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van . this is ben ( gary waddell ) , who is a friend of simon , and is also his unofficial counsellor . i would think that this character is the main comic element . it is hard to say though , as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud , unless you were intoxicated , male and very young ! maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though , and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject . as the quality of acting is variable , the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap , the lack of continuity is a positive boon . in fact , there is something about this film ( not the nudity ) that i find appealing . it is hard to define what it is , but it could be something to do with its bluntness , and downright 'aussie' attitude to carnal matters . the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention . sometimes it is very good , with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach , cliffs and a sunset . as nudity is a major factor in this film , framing is an important aspect of the camera work . there is no sense of gratuity in the framing , meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts . this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space' , and makes the film more tasteful . not an easy task , given the location for filming . maslin beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post-pubescent , testosterone charged males , nor a 'mills and boon' romance for under-appreciated women . maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre . the actors are not 'attractive' in the baywatch sense , and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere . it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement , other than perhaps to naturists . apart from the australian accent , the filming could have been in any sunny country . what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless ( cinema verite ? ) , and only australian cinema , and other medium sized national cinemas , could consider such a rash option . at the same time , these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity , and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much . it is always possible , given that maslin beach is now a collector's item , that the film might become internationally popular , but it is very unlikely . during this critique , i have been sounding highly negative , at times , about maslin beach . this is not the real position , as i found the film very easy to watch . i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people ( and problems ) . the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday , and a little low on spectacle . this does it no harm in my view , and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this . there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe , and with french film in particular . they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes , but with the everyday . hollywood is in direct opposition to this , and rides the crest of the hyper-real action/drama/angst wave . the pace too , is much faster in hollywood , but it is not reality . maslin beach is not exactly 'jacques tati' either , but it is on the right track , even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism , equality , gender orientation and so on , that are of such importance in current cinema . i am sure that you will either love or hate this film , with little room for a middle ground .",1,9

"this ""movie"" is more like a music video . kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies , he feels like making music , and when he is making music , he feels like making movies . the best thing in ""promise me this"" is the music , written by stribor kusturica . kusturica said in the same interview , that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise . ""promise me this"" has very little ""noise"" . i liked ""life is a miracle"" . it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later , but it had a beautiful plot . ""promise me this"" has no plot . i was awaiting this movie with big expectations , because i've read , that the script has been written by ranko bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters , who participated also in ""life is a miracle"" . ranko bozic writes great dialogues , but for kusturica they are ""noise"" , and much to my regret , i saw only two dialogues , which i could identify as written by ranko bozic . the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor . gordan mihic ( the man who wrote the scripts for ""time of the gypsies"" and ""black cat white cat"" ) said in an interview , that kusturica never follows the script . ""black cat white cat"" was the only script , for which kusturica said , that he will not touch it . according to gordan mihic , after all kusturica comes back to the script , and if he does not , he does not make a good movie . and i think this is the case with ""promise me this"" . he should have followed the script of ranko bozic . ""promise me this"" is billed as a ""comedy"" , but there are very few moments , which made me laugh . the comedic moments are in the same style as ""black cat white cat"" , but are not that funny at all . i think the difference comes from the fact , that ""black cat white cat"" was written by gordan mihic . however , i know some people , who liked ""promise me this"" , they find it very positive movie .",0,4

"re : pro jury although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful , the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story . one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know , but i doubt it . ""easily give away virginity"" ? what a shrewd remark about this film . truly . one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations , but my experience has been , more often than not , teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world . you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes ? that's sad . one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake , but i think not . and another ""expert"" opinion drawn from experience . dandy . one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into , and hang around inside , a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble , but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents , chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this . now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up . one final nit , throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome . there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome , but because it was never detailed , each reference distracts from each scene . of course there's probably an explanation . good job figuring that out ! now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery : although it was translated as a general ""foursome"" , the word ""&#269;etvorka"" has another meaning : it's a sports term used to designate a 4m or 4w setup - a rowing crew consisting of 5 persons : 4 rowers and a coxswain . this movie did not ring true for me . we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion . dude .",1,8
"this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art . what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed . besides following the play like a tv broadcast , there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games . this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory . today's tv broadcasting style , so different than that of 1986 , is still inferior in quality compared to this movie . the players are not the only stars . the audience , the referees , the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history . in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way . in that regard , today's tv broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality , although it is now much closer than before . there are several highlighted players : maradona ( argentina ) , elkjaer and laudrup ( denmark ) , francescoli ( uruguay ) , platini ( france ) , lineker ( england ) , rummenigge ( germany ) , butrague#o ( spain ) , socrates ( brazil ) , and sanchez ( mexico ) . this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986 , although most of them are well covered . across all the movie , there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams , even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves . this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique . because of what happened because of referees during mexico 1986 , much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely maradona-biased . much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen , that they are as human as the players , and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other . soccer rules do not allow referees to use tv based replays to make decisions , so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive . as a consequence , referees play an active part in the development of a game . their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie . the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup , compared to this one , is just a source of bitter disappointment . much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game , whereas this movie tells things from a more distant , unbiased point of view .",1,10
"i had high hopes for it when i heard that it was being made back in 2001 because i read ""the devil and daniel webster"" when i was a kid and i found it very interesting . they made some changes to the story that do not make much sense to me . daniel webster in the story was a famous lawyer from new hampshire in the story . in the movie he is an editor . a lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing jabez stone against the devil him/herself ( he was a man in the story , but was a woman in the movie ) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line . as an editor , it does not seem likely that daniel webster would have the skill to do this . the acting was decent by all except for alec baldwin and dan aykroyd . these are two actors that i like , they just did an awful job in this movie . it was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy , but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy . this might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind , and was then re-edited by somebody else . given this fact , it is surprising that it was at all coherent . i was surprised to see a fair amount of snl cast members in the movie , which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy . all in all i would have to say it was not completely awful , but it was not much good . if i could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it , i would . the ending was especially disappointing . as in the original story , daniel webster defeats the devil in the trial . jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie . . . literally , we are just brought back to the first scene with jabez , and then the movie abruptly ends . it actually looked as though they just replayed jabez' first scene over and called it the end . there is no indication that jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained , so who is to say he did not just repeat his mistakes over again , and perhaps over and over in an endless loop ? it was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense . the decent cast , and the acting of everyone except for baldwin and aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich .",0,2
"as a comic book reader , who still sees myself as a total kid at heart , i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie . i mean , there has not been a good superhero movie out for quite some time ( note : batman forever was not a good superhero movie ) . i really wanted this film to be good , and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema ( read blair witch project ) i was not disappointed . mystery men was definitely not a high-effects , tension-filled action flick , it was a comedy . and on that basis , it was a success . it had everyone in the small theater laughing , and got applause and laughs right through the final scene . stiller and garofolo are hilarious together , as always , and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness . william h . macy plays a great straight man , while kel mitchell and the fart-powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy . though the sets are bizarre ( and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner ) , and some of the jokes are obvious , it is still just plain funny . there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard , and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us . i definitely recommend this movie . although not an all-time classic , it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread . the writing is good , and the cast is great . if you are worried , plan on the matinee and pay less , but either way you will be pleasantly surprised . i mean , who among us does not root for the losers once in a while ?",1,8

"""this man's navy"" is , as other comments have indicated , a rare and well-filmed look at navy lighter than air ( lta ) activities . the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack . and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone . however , the first half of the movie is all about beery , his relationship with his service pals , and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother , and getting drake's leg fixed . only then does the second film start . the second film is mostly ltas in action , taking on a surfaced sub , guys get killed and much damage is caused . the look is fairly gritty and realistic , i imagine . then we shift to southeast asia . did the navy have ltas there ? never mind , this part is really wild , with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle . and the japs are shooting like mad . shades of vietnam , except the getaway is oh , so leisurely . this is a blimp we are talking about . in the end , a feel-good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war .",1,7
a question for you : a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . which film am i talking about ? every horror film you`ve seen ? yes that`s true but that`s not the answer i`m looking for . i`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . doesn`t help ? well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s pov . no futher forward ? okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? could still be any horror film you say . oh gawd this could take weeks so i`ll say the film i`m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away . yes that`s right the film is the third circle ( aka cubbyhouse ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? it`s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made,0,2
"normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b-horror movies . to me the basic principals behind a b-horror movie is it is camp value , heavy gore , lots of needless nudity , and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex . i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they are first demo in 1995 . the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed . when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder . i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i was not laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars . the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the ""hardcore goth kids who think death , destruction , sex , blood , and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps . that was really it . to me this movie seemed like 80 . 5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic . this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this ""movie"" really is just an extended cradle of filth video .",0,1

"this installment of masters of horror was terrible . apparently , mr . carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent , plausible dialog . there were times when i literally shouted at the tv for something to happen . maybe he thinks he building suspense , but carpenter needs to trim back that overdone , over-simplified musical score of his ( or his son's ) and advance the action a little bit . how many times did the girl say , ""oh no , i cannot have this baby !

"romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england , in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue , the ladies were charming and elegant , and the gentlemen dashing . `emma , ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath , stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role . a self-appointed matchmaker , emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another . coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage , she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend , harriet ( toni collette ) , but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying . meanwhile , her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr . knightley ( jeremy northam ) , whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's , and lend some needed balance to the proceedings . and emma , so concerned with what is right for others , neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all : her own . the world goes round and love abounds , but emma is about to miss the boat . luckily for her , however , the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings . now , if she can but stop long enough to realize it . but as everyone who has known true love knows , matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant , depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for emma , she must first recognize it , and seize the moment . mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful , feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world . there may be an air of frivolity about it , but in retrospect , this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone : love . and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing , it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable . it's a pleasant , affecting film , with a wonderful cast , that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place . it's light fare , but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow . the winsome paltrow , who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love' two years after making this one , seems comfortable and right at home in this genre . she personifies all things british , and does it with such naturalness and facility that it is the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether . she is simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy . she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner , very reminiscent of audrey hepburn . yet paltrow is unique . as an actor , she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `hard eight , ' `hush' and `a perfect murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively , and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own . but it is with characters like emma that she really shines . she is so expressive and open , and her personality is so engaging , that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch , regardless of the part she is playing . and for emma , she is absolutely perfect . jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley , and like paltrow , seems suited to the genre-- in the right role , that is; his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl , ' in which he played an italian prince , was less than satisfying . here , however , he is perfect; he is handsome , and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real . like colin firth's mr . darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice , ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr . knightley . also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette , as emma's friend harriet smith; and alan cumming , as the reverend elton . respectively , collette and cumming create characters who are very real people , and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film . and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema , and to films of any genre . the supporting cast includes greta scacchi ( mrs . weston ) , denys hawthorne ( mr . woodhouse ) , sophie thompson ( miss bates ) , kathleen byron ( mrs . goddard ) , phyllida law ( mrs . bates ) , polly walker ( jane fairfax ) and ewan mcgregor ( frank churchill ) . an uplifting , elegant film , `emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness . and even if it is only through the magic of the silver screen , it is nice to be able to escape to such a world as this , if only for a couple of hours , as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit . and that is the magic of the movies . i rate this one 9/10 .",1,9
"this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral . in fact , if they would called it sex at a funeral , they might have done better at the box office . but the film falls between two stools and cannot get up . the characters spout improbably bright dialog , but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human . one arbitrary , senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot , and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise . andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out , but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton , as of all things , a police detective ( do not they have a height requirement over there ? ) . ms . staunton seems unable to make a false move . would that we could say the same about the writer-director . if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus , stay away from this one . phonus bolognus on the half-shell .",0,1
"what a let down ! this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters . admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail , but i was nevertheless gripped and kept watching . david morrissey is always good value and he suranne jones were good leads . the muslim aspects were very interesting . we were tantalised with possible terrorist connections . but then morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon . the last episode was dull , dull , dull . the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the d nouement was unbelievably feeble . five hours of my life for that ? my advice : watch paint dry instead .",0,4
"buster absolutely shines in this episode , which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical ( and silent ! ) comedy that made him famous . it's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing i do not care for , as far as buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled . he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with roscoe arbuckle . my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode , and for giving buster's genius full scope . he did not have much time ( one episode ) to do it in , but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius .",1,10
"there's nothing i hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness . kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they cannot get laid . i do not really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes . the money put into this could have gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager . if you watch project greenlight you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system . anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that does not manage to say anything really , at all . when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world ? the revolution cannot come soon enough . go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits . thank you and good day .",0,1
"i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life . this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i do not know how i sat through an hour of it . i must have been in a coma that night . i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago . i could not even remember the name , but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it . it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today . yech ! vomit ! barf !",0,1
"it was very heart-warming . as an expatriated french , i particularly enjoyed this ""tv"" movie , which i think deserves a broader distribution . the acting was good , and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so strong and so natural . no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids . one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son ( leo ) , who has contracted hiv , and the youngest son ( marcel ) , to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation . the two characters progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo , who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs . . .",1,9
"this film was quite a surprise . i was not expecting much , to be honest . greta garbo's first hollywood film ? so what ? probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm-waving and facial contortions that low-grade silent films so often show . well , was i mistaken . greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me , because this film made her a star , and deservedly so . she instinctively understood the power of just standing still , or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long , lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen . i kept thinking to myself , how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film ? she was just years and years ahead of her time . the story is not all that interesting , it is the usual tale of love found and lost . it is only the performance of garbo as leonora , the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away , that gives it life . co-star ricardo cortez is serviceable , but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout . at one point he is made to wear garbo's clothes , leave in a huff , then ignominiously return and give them back . and let us not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife . way too ordinary , he did not have much of a career after this and i can understand why . but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonora's obsession . there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all . ""leonora , you are becoming conspicuous . "" yes , conspicuous indeed . if you really want to know what it is all about without seeing the whole film , just watch the last 30 seconds or so - garbo's glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything . ""she must be so happy , she has everything she wants"" - yes , garbo's face says it all about that . i have to see this one again , garbo is just amazing .",1,9
"some have praised _atlantis : _the_lost_empire_ as a disney adventure for adults . i do not think so--at least not for thinking adults . this script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore . the ""crack staff"" of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think _the dirty dozen_ ) but _atlantis_ represents one of the worse films in that motif . the characters are weak . even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . an md/medicine man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix-and-match quirks before . the story about how one companion , vinny played by don novello ( fr . guido sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing . only the main character , milo thatch , a young atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by michael j . fox , has any depth to him . milo's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head . and while the characters were thin at best , the best part about _atlantis_ was the voice talent . perhaps milo's depth is no thicker than fox's charm . commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner . although rourke is a pretty stock military type , garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . garner's vocal performance is the high point . i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory . additionally , don novello as the demolition expert , vinny santorini , was also notable for one or two well-done , funny lines--but i've always liked father guido sarducci , anyway . also well done was the computer animation . the background animation , that is . the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism that drove don bluth out the door . the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter . aside from landscapes , buildings and vehicles there is not much to impress . the plot was the worst . some say hackneyed or trite . i'm not so sure about that . any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment . shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint . so the treatment is the thing . and _atlantis_ obviously lacks that . i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section . the plot was bad . the plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense . to add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness . ** spoilers ** 1 . right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the ""coast of ireland"" should read the ""coast of iceland"" , we begin to have problems . the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as ""ireland"" , and completely ignore the older , latin term hibernia . but more than this , they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland . by making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated ""letter"" , the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post-roman date on the script . since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave . and without visible clues and less technology than milo had , made the inscription far less trustworthy . 2 . the shepard's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis , or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying ""in the king's eye"" . it must have been written after the sinking , but without even the technology that milo's expedition had , how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan . so how could it know more about anything after that ? and why would it be written in atlantian ? automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things . however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian . so it is got to be some sort automatic writing . since noone left in atlantis can read , it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface . this would have made more sense . but could also have been explained within the movie : milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams , etc . this needed to be explored in the movie . 3 . the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages . no-one expects that the original indo-europeans would be able to converse in europe , anymore than romans would understand that hard ""c""s or their day became french ""ch""s ( pronounced like ""sh""s , no less ! ) 4 . current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read , yet now are unable to read what they used to , or operate similar machinery . 5 . the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie . nothing seems to have happened to this culture . it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it . even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival , no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy . 5 . kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in--but any of it **hardly** qualifies her father for deification ! ! kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence . killed a bunch in the cataclysm , stalled progress ( not a lot killed here , but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody , if they were not boiled in lava first because the giant robots were not there to protect them . a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim's likeness , when kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis ! 6 . even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian , rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or ""phases of the sun"" diagram . 7 . if milo's grandfather had told rourke about it , it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo's reading it as part of the book . ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in rourke's hand , even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"" . unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in milo's head that somebody would try to steal it , milo would have suspected nothing . it's just thick-headed foreshadowing . 8 . the crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change . we learned that vinny , sweet , audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning . however , the ""change of heart"" falls flat . it was a change , and needed to be better motivated . hard to do with characters who were not given anything to begin with . 9 . niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome , instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from . it's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas . 10 . the ending stinks ! -- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness . with it is powersource restored , atlantis is no longer a weak power , needing coddling . the giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might . the technology is superior to ours , and definitely to early 20th-century . in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read , for what ? the whole idea is to leave their little quiet , chastened culture alone , not to send it into hyperdrive . ** end spoilers ** perhaps , the lost world plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps . the failures i find with the film agree with this idea . but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well . and pulp stories is part of the ""crap they cannot sell adults anymore"" , anyway . we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well . raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness . 4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot , it seeps ever lower .",0,4
"seriously , i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood , gore and repulsiveness , but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women . he , john cassavetes of ""rosemary's baby"" , talks about ruptured uterus , dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish ( ? ) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine . that being said , ""incubus"" is an ultimately strange horror effort . it is not necessarily awful although it is not very good , neither but just plain weird . the muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of flesh and blood ( even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature ) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters . none of these characters , especially not the main ones , come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets . the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he is a suspect himself , the town's sheriff ( john ireland ) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and does not even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district , the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens ( an old witch and her grandson ) are just plain spooky . all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns' women reproducing organs . the sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling . basically these are very positive factors in a horror film , but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for ""incubus"" to be a really good film . also , there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through ( like footage of a bruce dickinson concert ! ) and the usually very reliable john hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable . the final shot is effectively nightmarish , though . for me personally , ""incubus"" was a bit of a disappointment , but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded genre fanatics .",0,4

"ok , so it was written in 1996 , before 9/11 , so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world , is prescient . that's it . that's the good stuff . the acting . . . fair . the plot . . . silly . the ""twist"" . . . unnecessary . dooooooooooom it is not as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for ""plagues"" and how to contain them ? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem , as we saw after katrina . but they have a plan . it is not to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania . and if the virus is carried in the air , why was the plane door open and the ""shooters' standing there with no protection ? in fact , did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ? that would stop her . but not as dramatic . i'm a sucker . i always watch a movie to see the end , once i started it . but this was a waste of time , and for the most part , predictable . i saw it using a recorder so i did not have to watch all the ads , that was a plus . it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv . rubbish .",0,4
"the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as ""camp"" ( i . e . , the 60's batman show ) for tv and movie . thus you have combat sequences with subtitles ( come on ! ) , a cluelessly unromantic doc savage ( he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps , not an idiot ) , monk mayfair in a nightsheet ( a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights ) , and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute . and when they are not doing booming sousa march scores , the tinkly little ""funny"" music undercuts much of the drama . even as such , this movie is . . . okay . it's fun , and when it stays serious it is a very accurate representation of the pulps . except for monk , as has been mentioned before : he is hugely muscled , not obese . and long tom , who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude , not paul gleason with an ( inexplicable ) scarf . the green death sequences , for instance , are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children . but they are very close to the feel of the pulps . when the writers and producers get it right , they do get it right - i'll give them that . but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of , say , reeves' first two superman movies , think what we might have had then . i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic . there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage , but they are also trying to give in to the ""heroes must be camp"" attitude that batman created . one gets the impression there was a sober , pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said , ""hey , let us make it funny - it worked with the batman show 8 years ago ! "" but doc lives on , thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai . if macrauch am not doing a homage to doc savage in that movie , the man is truly demented . so when the series actually gets on tv ( allegedly mid-season in '99-00 ) , doc savage , updated to the 90's , will live once more .",1,7

"it's hard to put your finger on this one . basically i suppose it is a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a ( comparatively ) poor girl , whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family . it has funny moments , romantic moments , and touching moments . dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centred character endearing , liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts , but john gielgud steals the show as arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler . it's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack , and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit .",1,7
"geez , as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film - and i am glad of it ! ! ! was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great anti-gay backlash and i cannot say that i would blame them . the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american , what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare . the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments ( anti-white ) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs , unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's ""cast"" - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation , but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self .",0,1
"i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed ""masterpiece"" of the german new wave : 1 ) there are major flaws in simple exposition , in the basic communication of critical plot points , as relating to maria's abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband . how many viewers understood that the husband agreed , in exchange for substantial financial remuneration , not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead ? 2 ) the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental . the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald's will , on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald . in the final version , however , maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide . maria is then summarily blown up , rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise . 3 ) fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private , the political on the personal . contrary to what the critics and ""experts"" assert , i do not think it works . merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama . the selfish ambition of maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar germany . maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place , but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific . women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages . 4 ) lastly , there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect . unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting . strangely , for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust , it itself never mentions it once .",0,3

"""red rock west"" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script ( by john and rick dahl ) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film . it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage , dennis hopper , lara flynn boyle and especially j . t . walsh ( in a memorable performance ) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed . the film never had much publicity on release ( in fact i first caught up with it on tv ) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following . nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock . mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered $10 , 000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown ( the excellent j . t . walsh ) . he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne ( lara flynn boyle ) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists , turns and surprises - and double dealings - that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he cannot drag himself out of ! then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing ( played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper ) . when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow . some favourite lines from the film : nicolas cage ( to lara flynn boyle ) : ""i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it is an awful lot of money"" . j . t . walsh ( to cage ) : ""michael williams . well , michael , you are going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this"" . boyle ( to cage ) : ""you're not a killer ? "" . cage : ""that's right , no . but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here"" . boyle ( to cage ) : ""o . k . how you are going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10 , 000 from my husband ? "" . an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller ( just 98 minutes ) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals . any film featuring j . t . walsh is o . k . in my book and ""red rock west"" was one of his best . how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998 . the most prolific period for ""film noir"" was without any doubt the forties but ""red rock west"" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my ""top ten"" list of all time favourite films . i look forward to more like this from director john dahl . 10/10 . clive roberts .",1,10

"i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago , and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies : dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin , while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks . danny glover was cast as the bad guy , but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role . also , jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student . the tension was just not there , since the killer was known very early . the finale was , again , neither dramatic nor tense : nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next . all we could wait for was the end of the movie . all in all , a disappointing evening spent at the cinema .",0,3

"the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box . a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does not degrade . but the movie fails to get on with it . instead it pads for 45 minutes , noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery . since audiences do not benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out , it is a strange choice : the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic . once the fabric is discovered , the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs , and blue-collar co-workers want the invention squelched , leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical , and running from oppressors . i cannot understand why anyone would describe this as comedy . the tone is not funny or comical . it's more like serious social criticism of the day : that capitalism warps both supply chains and production . which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world . yes , that is probably true , but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact , the movie is simply an earnest argument . you'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here . this is more like a british meet john doe ( meet nigel doe ? ) .",0,4

"this 1984 version of the dickens' classic `a christmas carol , ' directed by clive donner , stars george c . scott as ebenezer scrooge . by this time around , the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and , happily to say , with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it . he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail , and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative , especially scott . one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction , ever-- was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film; but i think with his performance here , scott has now achieved that distinction . there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you have seen scott do it; simply put , he is scrooge . and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous . it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well , to be able to make a character so real , from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face , and to make it all ring so true . it's a study in perfection . the other members of the cast are splendid as well , but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance; and they do . frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley; a notable turn , though not as memorable , perhaps , as the one by alec guinness ( as marley ) in the film , `scrooge . ' angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past; edward woodward , grand and boisterous , and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present; and michael carter , grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come . david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit , bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge , and susannah york fares just as well as mrs . cratchit . the real gem to be found here , though , is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim; it is heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin , and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film . the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees ( fred holywell , and also the narrator of the film ) , caroline langrishe ( janet holywell ) , lucy gutteridge ( belle ) , michael gough ( mr . poole ) and joanne whalley ( fan ) . a flawless presentation , this version of `a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen , watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever . and forever after , whenever you think of scrooge , the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c . scott . a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience , this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home . i rate this one 10/10 .",1,10

"this is really a great unknown movie . perfect dialogue without the typical clich s . this movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off . it even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it was not overdone . once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be , not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in . i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all . now onto the actors themselves . laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal . it's a shame that he is only allowed to show his talent in his own movie . titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne's junky half-brother . eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film . paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord . i loved his acting since ""king of new york"" . but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan , who were paired perfectly as two of calderon's henchmen . once in the life is for sure a keeper . ****1/2* out of ***** .",1,10
"i saw this film on tv many years ago and i saw this film when i got this on tape . i thought that this was reasonably well done . it was not the best of all movies , but it was good enough . the movie has enough talent to inspire many people , especially younger kids . the acting was good , with danny glover leading the cast . the plot line was not very believable , but the script was well written . this movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans . it does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie . it directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film . overall , the film was good , but not great . i give this a movie a 7/10 .",1,7
"i was bored , around 10pm , so i watched this movie . and i could not stop laughing . everything was so ridiculous . the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up . one of the kids had a ring , that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years . it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster . it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously , especially when it has to do with eating worms . they act like everything is such a big deal , like if billy ( the main character ) does not eat the worms then the world will end . this is a good movie for little kids ( excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis' ) , but not for teens or adults who do not want to waste their time .",0,3

"pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films , it is got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second . by concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube , it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube , as we simply do not care about the characters inside . much of the film is simply boring , and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed crazy marine . after that , though , it just descends into over-the-top unintentional hilarity . the ending is fitting though , tying it back into the first one in an indirect way . the script is terrible , the acting mediocre at best , and the direction unimpressive . a much lesser follow-up .",0,1
"while the soundtrack is a bit dated , this story is more relevant in the u . s . now more than ever . with not only blue collar jobs but everyone's jobs being outsourced by u . s . corporations while the government profits and american suffer . peter strauss is emory , a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years . his wife is well-portrayed by pamela reed , who is very realistic , trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job . the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement , but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month ( outsourcing ) what they would have to pay strauss/emory in a day . never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their family . john goodman , gary cole ( as strauss' brother ) and a few other co-workers are also affected . it is very disturbing and realistic . some scenes between emory and his father are moving . emory hopes his local union will be able to re-open the mill , as they promise to do so . emory's brother , lee already sees the writing on the wall . there are no jobs left in the rust-belt ( ohio ) and they must move on . however where in the u . s . can they move to ? . where will it be better for a blue-collar steel worker ? . there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products . the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture , one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy . overall , a good message film about hard times right here in america . something that few care to face until personally affected . 8/10 .",1,8
"i was fully amped up to see this film . i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand . i should not have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark's worst film there is so much wrong with this film . first off , some of the acting is great , in particular nick stahl as 'the bully' , and the girl with the curly brown hair ( i cannot recall her name ) , but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable , especially leo fitzpatrick . he's a veteran of clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'kids' , but in 'bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually . the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student . no sorry , a high school student . . . one who has never seen a movie before . and i could not fathom clark's intentions . was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence ? it sure as hell did not stop him getting in a damn good perv . i'm no prude but i did not need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes . i still maintain that clark's best film is 'another day in paradise' . it's fantastic and i do not think he will ever top it .",0,2
"i read rice's novel with interest , and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths . however , i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation . the casting was based merely on physical appearance , and not acting talent ( with the obvious exception of peter gallagher , who was neither blond-haired , or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag ) . the cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious , but not in an entertaining way . i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe , and was surprised i made it to the end . a warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one .",0,4

"this is not my favorite wip ( ""women in prison"" ) , but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre . it is was produced by roger corman , who at this point had already produced a few wips . it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula . the movie takes place in an usa prison , not in a ""banana republic"" like most wip films . i'm not sure if that was a wise move , but it is an acceptable change of pace . writer-director demme really gets into his job , always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario . in fact , he is a little too ambitious for his own good . the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick . but do not worry , demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre . there is plenty of nudity and violence , something that will satisfy hardcore fans . the film is a little slow , but it is very entertaining . the cast is good . roberta collins is a wip veteran , so she does not need an introduction , and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden . pam grier is sorely missed , though .",1,7
"""it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable . "" and for good reason : they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman . and let us not kid ourselves : critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman pretensions , allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . what i do not get is this : why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman , but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ""ripping off"" hitchcock in his suspense/horror films ? in robin wood's view , it is a strange form of cultural snobbery . i would have to agree with that .",0,3
"i do not understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey . he has never been a very interesting film actor . the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit . alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo , definitely not stock types . although one cannot say their characters are well developed that does not make them any less funny . the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog , so that was certainly not a problem . the use of spanish gives it more authenticity . a very underrated movie , judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it . i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least . a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting .",1,7
"like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously , i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went' , ""yea ! ! ! this is it . this is the next film we are going to green light ! !

"a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand . not the actors' fault , but the writer/director , producers , financiers , etc . , need a very stiff talking to . maybe it thinks it is profound . it is not . this rape and ultra-violence , unlike that central to clockwork orange , has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding . it's no straw dogs , either , to which i have seen it compared . rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to , yet even in saying that i'm probably being a bit unfair on pete walker . revenge is a powerful human desire , but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort . i do not think it is particularly misogynistic , merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details -- the blood running down ga's leg post rape , par example . it's neither challenging nor confrontational , though i'm sure the film-makers consider themselves very 'daring' , just deeply unpleasant . is this as high as we can aim ? is this why those involved wanted to make films ? ( i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times ! oh the customs ! but the new spell-check on imdb would not let me post until i had removed it . likewise i had to remove square parentheses . get it sorted imdb . ) where is the lofty aspiration ? the noble impulse ? when you look at british film - the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers; carol reed's work with graham greene on fallen idol , our man in havana or the sublime the third man ( a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads ) ; the work of powell & pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex , violence and male emasculation look at ""the offence' dir . sidney lumet , from an original play by john hopkins; check out ""tunes of glory"" for something worth making , that has something to say . unlike the foregoing , straightheads is , alas , an altogether hateful waste of celluloid .",0,1
"paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film i've ever seen . often classed as a ""horror movie"" this , i believe , is a grave error . some journo once called it ""the thinking person's nightmare on elm street"" and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i cannot help but think it is a tag that is ill deserved and misleading . those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they are really not thinking at all . in fact , just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea . quite simply , paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart . as someone wiser than me once said , ""the film hits you on a completely emotional level"" , which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing . to be honest , i make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste , stop reading now because there is more to come . it's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives . even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work . in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood ( often overlooked ) in a seamless and convincing way . and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away . add to all this an incredibly talented director ( bernard rose ) , imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you are ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why i have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express .",1,10
"out of the first five episodes of hammer's short-running ""hammer house of horror"" series , this fifth episode with the wonderful title ""the house that bled to death"" is arguably the creepiest one . as a great fan of the hammer studios' gothic horror films for many years , i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently . so far , i've only seen the first five episodes , and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come , but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are , i will be satisfied . whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor , this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror . the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations . years later , william ( nicholas ball ) and emma peters ( rachel davies ) move in the house with their little daughter sophie ( emma ridley ) . soon after moving in , however , the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house , which is seemingly haunted . . . the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry , ""growing pains"" ( episode 4 ) , and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances . the film is also well-made in terms of effects , cinematography and score . ""the house that bled to death"" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale . the film delivers a creepy atmosphere , genuine scare moments and intelligent twists , and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end . overall , this is highly recommendable to hammer fans .",1,7
"this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant . gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes , 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11 . without using any spoilers , i would say that ken loach's piece is the jewel in the crown , and mira nair's short ( segment ""india"" ) , based on a true story , deserves to be made into a full feature film . one also realizes , while watching his short , why alejandro gonz lez i rritu is one of the best directors in the world today he simply is a master of the medium , who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter . unfortunately , not all 11 parts are made as well . youssef chahine , in his segment ""egypt"" , assumes the arab stance of the self-inflicted collective guilt , which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one . he fails miserably . chahine's short is poorly written and badly executed , at least enough to stand out amongst other , superior chapters of the film . despite the imbalance in quality , i would still give the film 7/10 for concept , if not for execution .",1,7
"well , maybe i'm just having a bad run with hindi movies lately . i asked the video store guy for apharan ( prakash jha ) but being a new release , was not available yet . so i had to settle for this one . it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i've seen ( and i've seen quite a few ) . no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world ! if imdb had negative ratings , i would give garam masala a -10 . i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai . all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up . for some strange reason , people expect good stuff from piyadarashan . i did not like hulchul , hungama , or his other films . hulchul , probably dubbed from tamil or telugu , came across as very loud , in-your-face fare that again did not make much sense except in a bollywood flick . this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains . who made him a director , even a bollywood director at that ? ? ? anyhow , to the film now . what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt . two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment ( is not it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office ? jezuz christ , now they are copying their own stories ! ) well anyways , there is some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love ( aka multi-tasking + multi-timing ) . what happened in the end , i've no idea . i switched off mid-way . what ridiculous junk . i cannot believe they even released it . and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth ! for which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate indian masses ( 700 mil at last count ) or the well-heeled nri desis staying in phoren ? either ways it does not matter . neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff . its a short review because there is nothing to write about but the usual bag of f-grade garbage . bollywood should change its name to follywood . and yes , this review is much better than the movie itself .",0,1
"a friend once told me that an art-house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats . of course , my imagination ran amok , trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work . well , now my imagination can be put to rest . i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work . i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky's films are slow-moving and inert . opinions being what they are , i found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works , which are wrought with meaning , beautiful compositions , and complex philosophical questions . upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky , i was excited to experience his films . with the exception of the open air ride through the fields ( stalker ) , this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done . it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning , even on a completely mindless level . it's supposedly ""gorgeously stark"" cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft . there is a no balance , no proportion , and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow . the main character is so inept and indecisive , it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner . i am also not adverse to non-plots or story lines that progress on multiple non-linear fashion . but there is not even a non-story here . one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost , as hair-pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short . i will not rule out that this may be one of sokurov's stinkers ( tarkovsky's solaris ) , but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky's heir-based on this film- would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle . c'mon guys , do not be afraid to say it . no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life . i do not profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably do not have russian values , but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky's work as something magical , a treasure and a gift to viewers . if it did not have sokurov's name on it , and it aired on say , saturday night live , i'm pretty sure nobody would ""read"" all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick .",0,1

"a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films , one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged . britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it , but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor . this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor , so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers . it's a couple of decades later , gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind . he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses . when students he is fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he is just all talk . this is a subversive film in that there is not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does , but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles . maybe . it's certainly no protest-by-numbers though , being too warm . where u . s . film may seem realistic because they are urban and gritty , this and other british films of recent years - those that do not try to match america for visceral thrills - are real because british humour reveals truths .",1,9
"dumb is as dumb does , in this thoroughly uninteresting , supposed black comedy . essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile , eventually morphs into an uninspired version of ""the three amigos"" , only without any laughs . in order for black comedy to work , it must be outrageous , which ""play dead"" is not . in order for black comedy to work , it cannot be mean spirited , which ""play dead"" is . what ""play dead"" really is , is a town full of nut jobs . fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton's character from ""a simple plan"" , while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of , well , jake busey . - merk",0,4
"this is not a movie you watch for entertainment , at least most people i know would not . it's portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well , the characters seem plausible , especially because you ""read their minds"" , something more often found in books and rarely in movies , however done very well in this piece . i would place it next to ""all quiet on the western front"" and ""die br cke"" in terms of leaving a lasting impression . i wish i could screen it at school , along with the other two movies - however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard - which is a shame .",1,9
"i really liked the first 2 seasons . because a lot of good characters disappeared later on . like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons , but this is the absolute reverse . jenny from the 1st season and valarie from the 2nd season were sabrina's friends , i really did not care for the others , jenny and valarie were her coolest friends . i think for some reason , the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason , they were so cruel to sabrina . but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash , that is the funniest episode . i also thought it was funny how libby was popular but she was always jealous of sabrina , and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with harvey . i just wished they could have made more better ones . i also liked how the first 2 seasons , during the opening credits sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume , like in the pilot episode where she is in the witch costume , i liked how she said ""this is so not me"" and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think , but this is a really cool show . it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left , it was longer good . but i still like to watch it , but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina . what i meant about the opening sequence is : the opening titles of seasons 1-3 shows sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen . at the end , sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing , then disappear . the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles . the opening credits of seasons 5-7 features sabrina at various locations around boston",1,9
"there is something in most of us , especially guys , that admires some really working class small town ""real men"" populist fare . and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top . hey , a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy , but i do not rate movies or actor/directors based on politics or personality . that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does . while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director , i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since . okay , you have the gist of this there is this good cop , a small town trooper , joe , played against type by david morse , who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars . the bad guy stops , gets out , shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead . there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone . so we know that joe , the farmer forced off his land into a cop job , is a good basic sort of guy . then his brother frank shows up , he is a sadistic , amoral bully , fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up . some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral , sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off . then there is mom and dad , marsha mason and charles bronson , who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple , then die off; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide , to advance the story for us . both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob . but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife . but joe has a nice wife , played by italian actress valeria golina , who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut . for me , that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool . but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car , robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do . then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them . so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater . accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate , except for the 60's era effect , to win the hearts of old hippies . the worst offense is that , since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song , ""the highway patrolman"" , that song was not included . so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife . the bartender is good ole ceasar , played by dennis hopper . so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves . so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away . instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night , and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe , the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence . oy , such dreck ! then to top off this drecky sap fest , there is some zen crap about the indian runner , who is a messenger , becomes the message , ala marshall macluhen ? see what i mean , sean has done much better than this so do not be afraid to miss this one .",0,4
"there have been so many many films based on the same theme . single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex , pays him and then ( guess what ? ) she falls in love with him , there is a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending . . . . . . this has been done many times . the thing is i knew this before starting to watch . but , despite this , i was still looking forward to it . in the right hands , with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours . this was none of these . this was dire . a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me . i truly did not care if she ""got her man"" or remained single and unhappy . a male lead who , after a few of his endless words of wisdom , i wanted to kill . just to remove that smug look . i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment . a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters . none of them seemed to have jobs , all of them had more money than sense , a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend . . . . plus ""i would miss you even if we had never met"" ! ! ! ! ! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross . . . . . i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name ""woody"" but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film .",0,1

"the acting is good , the women are beautiful , and the men are handsome , so if you are looking for well-acted soft porn , this movie is for you . otherwise , you are wasting your time . the motivation of the main characters , in particular the eponymous lead , is often a mystery . she could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film , not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit . was she protecting her father , who went off half-cocked , as it were , when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit ? was she protecting herself , with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter ? during the trial , this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes . conversely , her lover , who starts off as a narcissistic jerk , becomes a selfless hero during the trial . at least his motivation is clearer : he sacrifices himself for love . naturally , since no good deed must go unpunished , we are told that she never sees him again .",0,4
"of the many problems with this film , the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago , i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong . what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing . how much longer ? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously . that's staggering; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here ? their previous film , ""white zombie"" , was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films ( the mummy , dracula , etc . ) , and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines . revolt of the zombies , to the contrary , appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war . this would not only explain the opening , and the change of dean jagger's character into a megalomaniac , but it also explains why the zombies do not actually do much in the film , besides stand around , look frightening , and wait for orders - they are just allegorical soldiers , not the undead cannibals we have all come to love and loathe in zombie films . i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first , and only later , maybe , educational . and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies . truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history , but not one i can recommend , even for historic value .",0,1
"a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante . their previous collaboration on the first season's ""homecoming"" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways . this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered . the supposed ""payoff"" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing . if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial ""cleaning"" of the planet of it is human infestation , why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion ? why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king's ""the stand"" instead of having the male population butcher the females ? i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous . the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it . i like a lot of both dante and hamm's work but this was just unwatchable .",0,2
"it's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie . . . played by gig young . but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name . i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film , mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona . she was funny , angry , vulnerable , caring , and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania , and whose father was later killed during woar war i . as the ""man"" of the house , fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home . but fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much . geraldine fitzgerald is the middle , flirty sister , who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister's boyfriend ( gig young ) . if you are a stanwyck fan , this is a no miss .",1,8

"summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what is the hottest movie of the week , given 99 . 9% of the screens dedicated to screening it . ok , so i may exaggerate on the percentage , but you get my drift . besides stuff from hollywood , bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters , and from some of the trailers shown , i'm hyped to watch them too . tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 , but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas . when i watched jodha akbar , it was a full house , but it was not for tashan . after watching it , i knew why . it was entertaining , but it was fundamentally weak . just like it is literal english title , which means ""style"" , tashan is all style , but little substance . not that it does not have the usual star power , but scenes felt forced , and some bordered on a tad ridiculous , even for bollywood standards i must say . which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya , who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 , both of which i enjoyed tremendously . in his rookie directorial outing with tashan , while you cannot fault his direction , you would probably scratch your head over the plot , which was clunky at best . it tried to force too many things into the story , though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation , but that came a little too late , and only toward the finale , which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie , with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil . and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink , you have an assortment of vehicles appearing , and the one that took the cake , in a dhoom 2 homage , was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere . at best , tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy , and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters . saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff , a call center executive who gives english tuition , only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material . his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh ( kareena kapoor ) , who is not exactly who she seems , the meek and sweet natured hottie . she engages jimmy's services for her boss , mobster bhaiyyaji ( anil kapoor ) , who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it . and to complete the quartet , akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey , an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business . so begins a road trip of sorts , with friends who turned enemies , and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on . jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all , because he goes from zero to hero , executing moves that would shame rambo , in absolutely no time , which is quite out of character . kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men , and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes , and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee . every character has a backstory created , and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best , the most touching and the most fun of the lot , even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches . his wounds also heal automatically , which impressively puts wolverine to shame . and the best part is his theme song , which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries . but sad to say , that is the only tune that is memorable , something that cheers ""bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey"" . for most bollywood movies i watch , i will usually be able to , despite the obvious language gaps , emerge from screenings humming a tune or two . i was not able to do that after tashan , because the songs unfortunately just were not catchy at all . usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location . that i enjoy , versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain , or atop jagged rocks on the beach front . tashan probably did not take itself too seriously , but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story , you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous , and for continuity to be a little more careful as well . billed as a blockbuster , now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one . despite akshay kumr stealing the show , tashan could have been better on the whole .",0,4

"joseph l . mankiewicz's sleuth did not need a remake . it's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day . however , given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing; i really cannot say i'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience . the plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man , milo tindle , who goes off to see an older man , andrew wyke , to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man's wife . from there , a game of cat and mouse ensues . its clear right from the outset that director kenneth branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location , which has been changed from the charming games-ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment . i'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original; plus there is the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at . unfortunately , however , the positive elements of sleuth 2007 end there . the original film was over two hours long , while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes . naturally , therefore , that means that this version has less about it; and unfortunately it is the characters that suffer . the plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place . the film does not build the characters , or the rapport between them , enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense . one major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be very important once the twists come into play . here he has some kind of security fetish that does not really mean anything by the end . kenneth branagh's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there . the original thrived on it , but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous , and mostly unwarranted , occasions; which cheapen the whole thing . the final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion . after spending two hours with the original i understood , respected and liked both characters presented in the film - after eighty minutes of this , i hated them both . i do have some respect for branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film; but this is not a good adaptation of the great anthony shaffer play .",0,4
"it's always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into . she is at times intense , funny and even sexy in her role as lena , a ""colored"" woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town , south africa . danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner , boesman . willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lena's new living area . it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes . although it is based on a play , the late director john berry ( who also directed claudine ) opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format . he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play . just like diahann carroll in claudine , john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination . this is definitely a film worth searching for .",1,9

"i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations . in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times . unlike other meyer films , the sexual antics are down to a minimum . some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive . the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful . the film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts . it's as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation/ blackploitation by having a higher moral message . meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit . he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil . however , because they cancel each other out , you end up with nothing . because it so bad in so many ways , it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste . perhaps , because it is so bad , we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable .",0,3

"after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch , we stumbled on this . it looked appealing from the summary , at least , so we gave it a try . and here's the kicker : the first 20 minutes are interesting ! it's actually enjoyable ! oh , wait , spoke too soon . somewhere in there , the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental , right-wing christian brain-washing . not entirely sure what happens , but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there , finished writing this script , and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood was not clean . can they put warnings on this ? i refuse to support this religious idiocy . much like video games have rating systems , movies need some sort of symbol : maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse . unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story , and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you will convert your neighbors , do not waste your time . it's some of the worst junk that is come out in a very long time , and the radical religious nuts do not need anymore funding .",0,1
"this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s . the idea that a kid and a basketball star could ""change the world"" is pretty far-fetched , given how many ""children's peace marches"" and ""celebrity protests"" there were and are . but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament , because some apparatchik kids learned of a ""silent protest"" in the west , is ludicrous . what ended the cold war ? america's tough , dare i say ""reaganesque"" stance and the internal failures of socialism . it was not the peace marches , the ""die-ins"" or films like ""amazing grace & chuck"" , ""miracle mile"" , or ""testament"" .",0,1

( i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies' style , that could be termed ""zany beauty"" . ) vidor's direction is light but sure-handed , the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary , and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era , with many cameos , adds to the overall fun . it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well . for all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films , sit through this one and it may change your attitude .",1,9

"this is arguably john thaw's finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen . this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child . however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story . it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection . it is a pity that this story was not made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen , not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon . given the right guidance , john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie . a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time .",1,7
"this post may contain spoilers : although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league , this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library . why ? well , if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman : the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin , then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman . kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection . i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50's comics of batman . but i was blown away by the batwoman character , her look , her costume ( which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond ) and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through . if you want to know who batwoman is , then buy or rent the dvd . barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond . tim drake appears as robin , but his role is a small one and sadly , there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing , which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven ( his city in the comics ) . of the three suspects for batwoman , my favorite is kathy duquesne , who looks an awful lot like halle berry . kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects . when it comes to the villains , i'm glad the penguin was one of them , but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers . pengy just did not sound right . same thing goes for robin . the new guy did okay , but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia , they replaced him . it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson , who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in ""the batman"" series . and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he did not show up in the gotham knights episodes . the late john vernon will be missed . although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane , if he had to be replaced , they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo . i only wish they could have used two face , riddler , or the scary new version of the scarecrow . the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb . i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song , betcha neva . while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero , i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest , plus like i said earlier , it is a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman , which i think gives a good balance . i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie , but personally , it is well worth the purchase . i give mystery of the batwoman a 9 .",1,9
"the plot sounds vaguely interesting . . . a scientist ( bateman ) discovers how to transplant animal eyes and optic nerves into other animals , like humans . a young man ( monteith ) is blinded saving a coworker at work - the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human recipient . the recipient starts becoming more and wolf-like , but the effect is nothing more than ""weird eyes"" and running at night with dogs ! ( for the whole movie ) the budget is too low , the dialogue too stilted ( i laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk ) , and the acting too inept . long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks , eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild . way too long even at 90 minutes , boring , and devoid of ideas . the military want to use the eye transplants to give wounded soldiers back their eyesight , and presumably want to militarize the technology . there's a silly subplot about a beautiful indian girl ( korey ) who thinks she can help , using indian wisdom about the wolves . they make love while music heavy on drums and indian chanting is heard - crazy , man ! the love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder - who edited this turkey ? ! a grouchy ""medicine man"" who spouts platitudes seems to do little , except for adding atmosphere . here's two ridiculous scenes . a worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their cages . she gets scared , looks left at the monkeys , turns right , turns left , turns right , turns left . . this goes on for a while ( who edited this ? ? ) . run out of the damn lab ! it was so stupid i started laughing . another ridiculous scene - our hero is at home , escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive - he leaves the window open , the military guys go to the open window , look out the window , they say ""looks like he was here"" , and leave ! he went out the open window , guys ! ! crazy . near the end of the movie , military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees , when obviously nothing is there - easier to place the squibs i guess . they have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees , but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife ! ! ! shoot the guy ! ! who wrote this trash ? ? there's a pointless confrontation at the end , and believe me i'm not spoiling anything for you - there is not enough plot to spoil . i figure the whole thing was a tax write-off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie .",0,2
"i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran , so i did not know who had done it at first . the longer i saw it , the more i started thinking , ""jesus , this looks like an albert pyun flick . "" wasn't quite sure , though , for two main reasons : the photography was quite good ( and the utah desert scenery was beautiful ) , and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon , a murderous cyborg , but with some style and a sense of humor . paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out , because albert pyun has not written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career . unfortunately , paulin does not have all that much screen time before he is gone , and the movie's the worse for it . lance henriksen , playing the evil head cyborg , growls his way through his part , as he is done in countless other movies like this . i do not know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it . he goes through the movie looking ( and sounding ) like he just woke up , and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent . kathy long , the nominal hero , has a great body , is attractive , has a great body , fights extremely well , has a great body , and does not have an iota of acting talent , but that does not matter in a movie like this . this being an albert pyun film , it is full of the trademarks that we have all come to know and love : inane and idiotic dialog , choppy editing , and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured , ""ah , nobody'll ever notice . "" as bad as this movie is , however , it is a shade above most of pyun's other efforts--this is ""citizen kane"" compared to his brain-numbing ""adrenaline : feel the rush"" , for example . the fights are pretty well done , if repetitive ( after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other , you find yourself saying , ""alright already , go to something else"" ) , and long is very athletic ( and , as a previous poster has noted , has a great derri re ) . it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination , but it is not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun's usual extravaganzas . you could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse , granted , but worse nonetheless .",0,3
"the oddly-named vera-ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice-skating : blonde , girlish , always delightful to watch , but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material . when i watch vera-ellen's sexy apache dance with gene kelly in 'words and music' , i cannot help noticing that her blouse ( yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes ) seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag . for some reason , the very american vera-ellen starred in *two* musicals ( made several years apart ) set in edinburgh , a city not noted for its tap-dancers : 'let's be happy' and 'happy go lovely' . in the latter , cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh . there's a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival , which is nonsense : the festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows . we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile : apart from a few highland accents , there is absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie . the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning , when we learn that the title of romero's show is 'frolics to you' : this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks will not . vera-ellen is , as usual , cute and appealing and an impressive dancer , but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad . the plot -- mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson -- is brainless , though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals . romero is less annoying than usual here , probably because ( for once ) he is not required to convince us that he is interested in bedding the heroine . the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes . the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals; his wistful rendition of ""she is my lovely"" was a big hit in britain in 1937 . here , he shows up in several scenes as romero's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number , nor even any real comedy . it's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'lovely' , sure to evoke howes's greatest hit -- would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do ! the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts ( whom i worked with once ) shines in one restaurant sequence , and there is a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall . as vera-ellen's confidante , somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard : it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go , but does not match either . val guest has a story credit , but this movie does not come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies . the colour photography is wretched , though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood's process work . 'happy go lovely' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster , with 'waster' being the operative word . i'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 .",0,4

"after being a big fan of the ten minute t . v episodes of 'stella street' , i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed . i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t . v episodes , and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing , as if the actors had said them once , and could not be bothered to say them again . i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again . *spoilers* the plot of the film starts with stella street ( a normal english street in surrey ) , gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years' , including michael caine , al pacino , jack nicholson and the rolling stones . all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . there are some nice moments , but on the whole , the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring . *end of spoilers* in the t . v episodes , all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast . i think this was a mistake . her impersonations were not funny , and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do . if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street , you may find this film entertaining . but if you were a fan , i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated . 4/10",0,4

"( david h . steinberg ) 's script seemed initially having some real smart points that could have made good romantic comedy , but but but , oh dear ! what did ever happen in the way ? ? ? ! ! ! ! i'll tell you what happened . originally it is ( animal house - 1978 ) and ( porky's - 1982 ) . although that was long time ago , but those are the pioneers , the godfathers of the new genre : the crude teen comedy . then the 1990s came . after important instances that became smash hits ( repulsive ones am i add ) such as ( problem child - 1990 ) , ( dumb and dumber - 1994 ) , ( the nutty professor - 1996 ) , and ( there's something about mary - 1998 ) which i think slackers is affected by , there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era , the one and only : ( american pie - 1999 ) which's undoubtedly and incomparably a genre's icon . after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy , cum laude nasty , to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion ! i believe that ( slackers ) had a smart plot first as a script , then its makers got to add some real big amount of : rudeness , filthiness , strangely shameless sex to be made - at those days - as easy as pie ! like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as : masturbation , oral sex , urination . . etc just to look a la' mode . they're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits , and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies . the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it . some of its moments looked literally horrible , and that as you see is the point . it's all in ( jason schwartzman ) 's looks and performance; memorably disgusting to the utmost . so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what was not done before of pure skinning images . to be more like a horror where you are asking all the time; what nastier would happen ? ( vomiting , farting , . . etc ) ; these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays . though even if you hated it you have got to love something ( mostly for being bold ) , for me it was only gina gershon cameo's scene . anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outrages-for-outrageousness , like an adolescent's naughty dream . though the majority of it was near to anybody's nightmare . what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work , and not another cheap , another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be . remember well the details of stealing the exam ( the first 2 minutes ) , so the movie's main plot ( weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys ) through the pattern of ( boy loves girl , and girl loves another boy ) because save that , it is nothing but a candidly schlock . it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys , who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything , would do . it ended up as being , and i'm sorry to say it , a smiling sh*t ! at its end it said something ( can you imagine ! ) about how it is the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win , totally like this comedy itself . it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie; which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one . . once ! and it does not need much to understand that this movie's makers were the real slackers ! maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood , but even if . . the final result here was not at least witty by any sense of the word . p . s : its scriptwriter ( david h . steinberg ) , who wrote the story of ( american pie 2 ) as well , has a main page at the imdb where you will find under the ""additional details"" his usual ""plot keywords"" which are : sex / vulgarity / crude humor / . . . they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women !",0,1

"watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing . i was too young to watch it when it was originally released , and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago , but it has absolutely stood the test of time , and i have watched it several times since . everything about this film is brilliant , from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman ( even though i know this movie well , i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks , or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way ) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences . it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one . midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools . 10/10",1,10
"well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directions . for fans of these crazed italian thrillers , they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he is put through . the camera-work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd , but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well . the less you know about the story the better to make it work . the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story does not have that extra sexual or psychological , or both element to put it over the top . it's more a routine mystery , the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws . the recent dvd ( 2005 ) release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film , unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely .",1,8
"in s o paulo , the upper middle class teenagers cristiano , chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class , they go to a party with drugs and booze . on the next day , after their classes , the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl . the girl dies , they panic and decide to get rid off the body , but cristiano's mother arrives , startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase , breaking her neck . the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill , but along the night other tragedies happen . the polemic and shameful ""cama de gato"" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth , and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years . the shallow , tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste . the screenplay is not funny , with stupid lines and dialogs , and boring , manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end . the acting is terrible , apparently with many improvisations , but no talent , and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash . the camera , framing , cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality . the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking ( probably it is a plus , since this flick sucks ) . the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex-exploitation . my vote is one ( awful ) . title ( brazil ) : ""cama de gato"" ( ""bed of the cat"" )",0,1

"have never understood why the macdonald-eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone . to me , ""i married an angel"" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings . the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical , the script is by the reliable anita loos ( ""san francisco , "" ""the women , "" ""gentlemen prefer blondes , "" etc . ) , the rodgers and hart tunes ( albeit altered a bit by macdonald-eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest ) are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart ( oscar-winner for scoring ""the wizard of oz"" ) , and best of all , the ""singing sweethearts"" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings . try to show ""rose marie"" or ""sweethearts"" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still , but this offbeat , fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain .",1,9
"i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels : well , this transposition is simply accurate , intelligent , delicate , careful , tactful , respectful , intense , in a word , perfect ! ""emma"" is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels , thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters . the movie respected this subtle irony , not disregarding the comic element ( miss bates above all ) . what engaged me in the novel , and the movie renders it clearly , is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist , and the modern look with which women , men , and their relation are handled , and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century , who lived almost a secluded life , could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did : that most and still fascinates me . we can feel this modernity throughout the movie : just replace costumes , and use a more current language but the situations , the feelings , the ideas would be extremely modern . i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives , or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations , and still the difficulty in revealing , and giving expression to one's feelings , especially love : every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value . the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances : a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role ( nowadays she would be probably too mature for it ) , toni colette is simply great . and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear ! and then , the breathtaking english countryside , where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension . . . a really enjoyable and deserving movie .",1,9
"this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description . but to me it was a bit of a let down . very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening . it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed ( definitely not in sequential order ) . also , nothing of any consequence was being filmed . i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part , which is different from the typical hollywood film . but this one befuddled me to no end . i viewed the film a second and third time and it still did not do anything for me . i still do not really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey . if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life , i guess he succeeded . but i was looking for more . needless to say , i cannot recommend this movie to anyone .",0,4

"" the story is of an american soldier named sgt . paul ryker ( lee marvin ) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer . his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces . so successful is his cover , he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major . however , he is thereafter captured by the americans , put on trial as a traitor and spy . stating he was ordered to defect , he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence . he is convicted and sentenced to hang . however , his conviction is doubted by capt . young ( bradford dillman ) , his prosecutor . convincing commanding gen . amos baily , ( lloyd nolan ) of his doubts , he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed . the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves , murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt . max winkler . korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's . due to its superior script and powerful message , this drama has become a courtroom classic . excellent viewing and recommended to all . ****",1,9
"as a casual listener of the rolling stones , i thought this might be interesting . not so , as this film is very 'of its age' , in the 1960's . to me ( someone born in the 1980's ) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap , but i am sure this film was not made for me , but people who were active during th '60's . i expected drugs galore with th stones , i was disappointed , it actually showed real life , hard work in the studio , so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film . i have not seen any of the directors other films , but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing , sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash , badly directed , tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value . my only good opinion of this is that i did not waste money on it , it came free with a sunday paper .",0,3

"""hey babu riba"" is a film about a young woman , mariana ( nicknamed ""esther"" after a famous american movie star ) , and four young men , glenn , sacha , kicha , and pop , all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade , yugoslavia . the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz , blue jeans , or anything american it seems . the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant , and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties . in the wake of changing communist politics , they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 ( the year before the film was made ) . i enjoyed the film with some reservations . the subtitles for one thing were difficult . especially in the beginning , there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all . perhaps the conversational pace required it , but i could not always both read the text and absorb the scene , which caused me to not always understand which character was involved . i watched the movie ( a video from our public library ) with a friend , and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative . this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability , idealism , and strong and loyal bonds to each other . there is a main flashforward , and it was intriguing , keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast , and what had actually happened . i would rate it 7 out of 10 , and would like to see other films by the director , jovan acin ( 1941-1991 ) .",1,7

"my father was the warden of the prison ( he is retired now ) showcased in this documentary and i've grown up around the prison life , so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie . i will say this , the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people . they were brave enough to a ) show up and tell this story , b ) get inside these inmates minds and hearts , and c ) do all of this responsibly . responsible to their art and , more importantly , responsible to the inmates and staff of luther luckett correctional complex . they should be commended without end for this work . to take 170 hours , yes hours , of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect . i saw this film under circumstances that only a very , very few were able to see it . i was at the inmate screening . i was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen . i saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you , it was a very profound experience . these men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases , yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves , even if they view themselves as unredeemable . how many of us have the courage to do this ? how many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment ? to see them react to the film was an experience i am eternally grateful for , and i will never forget that . i thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives , i thank my father for making all of this possible , and i thank philomath films for taking the time to pour their blood , sweat , soul , and tears into this project . this movie will change everything you think you know about prison life , and the inmates held within it .

"cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie . unfortunately , that is not saying much . it has a competent cast of second-rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances . it is efficiently directed , entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot . it looks ok , but is ponderously over-plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded . for example , the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many . the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything . tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia ( nor is she ) . julia's 'feminine intuition' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development , but it does not . similarly , pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time . these are just symptoms of the underlying problem . the movie is structured like a mystery but it is not . as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading , so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know . the ending is particularly lame . julia is menaced purely by accident . lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her , it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all . he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done . it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads . then it occurred to me . someone said : ""those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko , so why do not we make one like that ? "" cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people : mysterious , troubled , shape-shifting woman falls in love with the hero , is apparently frigid , kills people , arouses the suspicions of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end . but 'modelled on' does not mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin . it copies , but does not understand what it is copying . it is obviously trying for the low-key , suggestive lewton style , but this approach does not follow through into the story . lisa is no irene . she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her . we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia , so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york . there is never any doubt about her purpose . neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake . then again , during her nocturnal prowling we get , not one , but two attempts at 'buses' . neither come off , because the director does not understand what makes a 'bus' work and , in any case , they happen to the stalker , not the person being stalked . these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have , but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation . plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery , but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time-passer came out .",0,3
"first , i should mention that i really enjoyed ishii katsuhito's previous film ""samehada otoko to momojiri onna"" ( ""shark skin man and peach hip girl"" ) . although it owed a debt to tarentino's ""pulp fiction"" , ishii's cast was up to the task of carrying the story , and the entire film crackled with energy . the scenes between asano tadanobu and gashuin tatsuya were particularly engaging . there was action , intrigue , bizarre characterizations , enough sex to keep things interesting , and an utterly unpredictable story line . so it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that i began to watch ""party 7"" . and my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits , which left my wife and i actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were; the mix of anime and live-action work was brilliant ! then , the actual movie started . actually , it did not so much ""start"" as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there , fumbling through its pockets , looking uncomfortable . the entire film takes place in three rooms . one is a futuristic voyeur's paradise ( borrowed a bit from ""shark skin man . . . "" ) , another is a travel agent's office , and the third ( and far the most used ) is a seedy hotel room . in that room , a cast of seven characters meets and . . . does approximately nothing . really . i'm no stranger to ""talking"" films . one of my all-time favorites is ""my dinner with andre"" , the talkiest of all talking films . ""my dinner with andre"" is far more exciting , and it just has two middle-aged men discussing their lives over dinner . the key is that andre gregory and wallace shawn tell interesting stories . the cast of ""party 7"" literally just whine at each other for the entire film . ""no , you do not ! "" ""yes , i do ! "" ""no , you really do not ! "" ""yes , i really do ! "" ""no , you really , really do not ! "" yes , i really . . . "" you get the idea , i hope . i wish the directer had . ""party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film . there is only the flimsiest of plots ( money stolen from the yakuza , just like in ""shark skin man . . .

dig ! i would say to anyone even if you do not like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts . it's fun and fascinating . along the same lines comes dig ! a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books . right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad . filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame ( thanks to that vodaphone ad ! ) and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes . as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights . all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able . like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band . dig ! on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band . still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path . dig ! is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous .,1,7

"gregory peck's brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities . certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war ( and possibly ever ) macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions . he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace , yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions , yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter , yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states; he shows great respect for other cultures ( particularly in the philippines and japan ) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country . all these things are held in balance throughout this movie , and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man , although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country , and especially the army he devoted his life to . peck's performance was , as i said , brilliant - to the point , actually , of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film ( which is perhaps appropriate , given who he was portraying ! ) with the possible exception of ed flanders . i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur : sarcastic ( repeatedly referring to macarthur as ""his majesty , "" ) angry , frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply will not respect his authority as president . marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur's wife jean , devoted to her husband ( whom she herself referred to as ""general , "" although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one . ) i very much enjoyed this movie , although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur's early life . i have always chuckled at macarthur's reaction to eisenhower being elected president ( ""he'll make a fine president - he was the best damn clerk i ever had"" - which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be , especially to his military commanders during wartime . ) well worth watching . 8/10",1,8
"although this film is somewhat sanitized ( because it was made at a time when people just did not talk about sex ) , it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation . not surprisingly , it was paid for by the kotex company , though what may surprise many is that disney made this film--as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s-60s . however well made the film is , though , i think the film maker's missed a real opportunity . instead of the nice female narrator's voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they would used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang ! ! i know this would have given old walt a heart attack , but wow that would have been a great film ! by the way , although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film , it does adequately explain menstruation in general . however , it does lack some details ( especially about intercourse ) that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet . now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation .",1,8
"sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece . i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has . it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama , interesting and sympathetic ( and also non-sympathetic ) characters , some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry . sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century , i think . they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love . sammo is interested in local baker girl ping ( nina li chi ) while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with . many other characters get introduced , too , and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong ! soon we get to know , for instance , that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists , too , and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created . as well as some nice drama . the film has a great cast . the leads are all very good and restrained ( not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors ( 1987 ) , for example ) and they are also , thanks to the carefully written screenplay , pretty likable and easy to identify with . the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai ( the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2 , ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2 ) , the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting ( john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others , pedicab driver included ! ) , the shaw veteran liu chia liang ( whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks ) , alfred cheung kin-ting ( the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988 ) , the late great lam ching ying ( best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies ) to name just a few . in fact , the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production . the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character . they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love , no matter what is your past or what you have done for living , get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner . also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship , and of course love . still i think what fennie says to max ( about the future ""bad cooking"" ) is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively , unfortunately . but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in . which is the action , the outrageous and over-the-top action . the fight scenes include traditional kung fu , some sticks , meat cleavers and the like and they are used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever , jackie chan's drunken master ii ( 1994 ) , they really are that great ! there are wires and they are used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched . simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver . also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs . pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination . still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as sammo is , like the late bruce lee , willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa , and i think this kind of morale , no matter how obvious or shallow it may be , is a good thing even in a harmless film like this , as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment . the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america ( for example ) would understand or like at all . the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing . also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping . still , the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this , and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction , of course . pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements . if the few minor flaws were not there , this could rate even brighter and higher . 8/10",1,8

"another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned panjab . dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut . he has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life . the treatment of the subject is very delicate . even though we have not been to the region during that time , the sets and costumes look real . unlike most movies made on partition , this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience , but on its after-effects . the characters come to life . priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance . manoj bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man . the rest of the cast has done a good job too .",1,8

"""this is not a love song"" is a brilliant example of the chase genre , which many people think has an underlying meaning . the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal . i believe that heaton is in love with spike , but spike is too naive to see this . i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences . heaton shows great intimacy towards spike . with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike's name on the top of his letters . one thing i've noticed when looking at external reviews , is that when the film has been slated , the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film , as they have not even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike . i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers have not recognised it , when they use phrases like : ""who is heaton ? what's he doing with a retard like spike ? "" this person , however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark . spike shows noticeable signs of having a . d . d , although i do not think this person has realised this , as he seems to be using the word ""retard"" as a derogatory term . i really enjoyed this film . although it is not for the faint hearted . the film is exceedingly character based , after the shooting until the end there is not much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes . unless you are used to watching such deep , gritty films , stay well away .",1,9
"come on ! get over with the pakistan bashing guys . bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers . i am a huge bollywood fan- but anti-pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay , cinematography , action sequences- everything . i'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda , and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say : give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses .",0,1
"the film looks super on paper . a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold , especially with this excellent romcomic cast . i'm afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves . adam brooks' script may well be to blame but you would expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda . instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france . jean reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and i guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part . mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake ( s ! ) so perhaps he was ok with this . . . 3/10",0,3

"""the garden of allah"" is a prime example of ""popular women's literature"" , turn of the xxth century style , combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of catholic guilt . just as jane eyre could not really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins , or the heroine of ""rebecca"" could not find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife ( and her castle burned down around her ) , or poor psyche could not leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs , domini , the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe , can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows . like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours , this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book : basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late . the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act . it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards . oh well . . . it could have been much worse and it often was . . . without the religious overtones , the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick : oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic , shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery , all passion spent , leaving her to clean up his mess . and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's ""thais"" , a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression , some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name , thankfully . but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism , of course , is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering , vibrant life . imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all , a truckload of worthy character actors ( including one cute dog ) , a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the ""composed film"" that michael powell ( who , ironically , had a bit part in the 1927 silent version ) always dreamed about , tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic , operatic exoticism , a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object , characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next , dialog is sparse , vague and suggestive , the art direction is close to celestial , flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent , the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats , saints , doomed but horny sinners , mystics or poets . ahh . . . hollywood ! the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable . the bit rate is very high throughout , the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2 . 0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession . a historical note on this sort of ""women's subject"" : the following year ( 1937 ) , julien duvivier , visibly inspired by ""the garden of allah"" , directed ""carnet de bal"" , where a very similar clothes-horse butter-will not-melt-in-her-mouth heroine ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa ) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book . she finds them all in time , only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood , overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences . it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later .",1,8

"sharp , well-made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads . i have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger , more complex , and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home . i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism , and globalism's effect on poorer nations ( however people feel about it ) . rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox ( not that there is anything wrong with that , other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted ) , this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads , how they are manufactured , by what people , and under what conditions , and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process . it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process , including workers , factory management , american importers , and finally , the consumer at the end of the chain . i felt a little sickened by this; equally by the mardi gras revelers , but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course ( even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed ) . the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end , made a particular impression . but that was just my reaction; i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently . unlike other documentaries on this subject , i do not think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this . this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume . if you have ever bought a product made in the far east , this should give you something to think about . outstanding and highly recommended . need to see more documentaries like this . kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film .",1,9

"there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii . but sadly , even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention , there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks . tachiguishi is one of them , and even though i loved it to bits , it is not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it . in between his big and serious films , oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects . while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category , oshii has really outdone himself with this one , creating something that is very hard to classify , even as a freaky japanese flick . go figure . at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video . but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture , oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes , scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level . oshii's approach on the subject has close ties with dai-nipponjin , as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be . deadpan humor taken to the extreme . but that is not all , rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation . a weird mix of live action , photography , digital animation and puppets on a stick . performed and acted out ( or posed , if you want ) by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less , as the project was supposed to be as low-budget as possible . and if you think that just about covers it , know that the film is extremely dialogue-heavy , making it a good companion piece for innocence . the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural , political and even philosophical angles , fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues . and to make it even worse , the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs , making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material . needless to say , multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film . that said , on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious . various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post-war japan . the film plays like you would expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold , but somehow the big and crudely animated cut-out photography limbs of which figures are assembled do not quite make it all that serious . the range of characters introduced is sublime , shinji higuchi taking the cake as cow-creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast-food chains with his gang of bull/people . oshii regular kenji kawai provides , besides a pretty comical performance , a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky , strange and comical . a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects , complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film . visually the film is very atmospheric , though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective , remains toned down , only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time . which is not exactly a bad thing , seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy . despite that , the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film . beware though , because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer . if you do not speak japanese , there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention . on top of that , the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow . the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about , i'm sure i missed many of the finer points of the film . tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into , but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it does not let off from there on . i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs . a dub would actually be best for a film like this ( much like container ) , though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for . with all of that said , i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film . it's rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works . the film is smart , looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity . it is immensely funny , even if you cannot catch all the details on the first viewing . but be sure to at least get this with decent subs , as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all . tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and i'm not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe ( and the rest of the western world ) is still waiting for a sign of this film . but for those that like oshii , appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits , it is a film that cannot be missed , even though it could just as well misfire . 4 . 5*/5 .

"this was the first sequel i'd seen ( apart from return of jafar ) and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original . i was horribly disappointed . the storyline was , basically , the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around . ariel and eric have a daughter , melody who is not satisfied with life on land . she wants to become a mermaid . however , ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when melody finds out she is upset and angry . and she then decides to run away , and she becomes a mermaid . so she is happy swimming around , and ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid . the story does not sound too bad written down , but the clich s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious . and adding the fact that melody is , overall , extremely annoying , and the movie becomes almost unbearable . there's also a whole load of other new characters-tip and dash being two of them . they are not too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of timon or pumbaa ! the songs leave a lot to be desired too , they just do not have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did . the animation obviously did not have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it is jumpy , and not much imagination is used for the characters movements . another piece of advice-try to forget about ariel's original character while watching this movie . the beautiful , rebellious , curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland , boring wife and mother , and her trademark red hair is all tied up . this is much better viewed if you have never seen the original-you will have nothing to compare it to . however , all in all , it could have been worse-it is not as bad as certain other sequels , such as cinderella ii . but it is not in the same league as the original . but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they will lose all their older fans .",0,3
"there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie . the girlfriend and i both love action films . especially fight scenes ( bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome ) , but this movie was not entertaining . five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and ""angry"" facial expressions . the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times . the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique . the music is not good either . they fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets , because these guys are thugs . the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas . everything about this movie is classic b-style . the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway . the film is called ""honor , "" but there was no honor in making this film . it was simply a waste of money , and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable . go see felon instead . the fight scenes and situations are more real .",0,3
"this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable ""gotcha ! "" at the end of each . really , there is no character development and no real plot to speak of . there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms . it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid ( who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm ) and his ghost mom ( with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like ""the ring"" ) take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out , two-dimensional excuses for human characters . this english-language version of ""the grudge"" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily , but not really what you ought to be living on . not recommended .",0,4

"though this may not necessarily be a so-called ""classic"" film by today's standards , it is still worth seeing . the main reason why is because after experiencing this film , you get the feeling that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's , no matter however good or bad . i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo , and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons , the film is far from being simply ""thrown together"" . my point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused , the film has done it is job : it is conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry . it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified . as such , ""zabriskie point"" may not tell a very good ( or interesting ) story , and at the same time its characters may be one-sided and predictable . however , it also conveys so well this sort of clich d , rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share . even the anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as the gov't they rebel against .",1,7
"the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention , in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china . however , i found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating , particularly to a western audience . at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart , as they were filmed from such a distance . two hours in and i was totally past caring . as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china ( and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema ) , i could not engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into . it begs the question : if i disliked it , who on earth would like it ? give me zhang yimou , give me chen kaige . give me the work of just about any other chinese director i've ever seen . this sorry effort just does not measure up at all . i'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark .",0,2
"in contrast to my fellow reviewers , i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see . yes , the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal , the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping . something must be lost in the translation of the word ""bloodsucker"" from the italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence , so tacked it onto the film anyway . this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film ! now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s . i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli ( credited most often as ""krista nell"" ) . the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s . i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list , it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned . i think krista nell played ""cora"" but underneath that massive hair style , costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure . there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out . maybe something is lost in the dubbing process . what were the positive points ? well the music was atmospheric and of course if you are into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there . the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island . it purports to be set in ""ireland"" ( north or the republic ? ) in 1902 , so everyone sports period piece costumes . some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes ! ! anyway an enjoyable romp . i rated it 4/10 .",0,4
"i wish more movies were two hours long . on the other hand , i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long . ""gone with the wind"" , ""gettysburg"" - that is about the length i've come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even ""gettysburg"" lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of it . by contrast ang lee's film is bloated and uneventful . it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours . that was not a compliment . it's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation : at the time it feels as though it will never end , afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all . the film gets off on the wrong foot , as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage ( bad mistake ) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe . the central two are jake , the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln , and jack , an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares . ( i had to re-read that sentence to make sure i had not written ""jack"" instead of ""jake"" at some point or vice versa . ) the two go off to become ""bushwhackers"" - southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cannot even be bothered to join the official southern army , which i presume they think is for sissies . i'm afraid lee lost me right there . it's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes : if we have some independent reason to like them , or feel as if we know them in some way , then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more . not so here . we are not properly introduced to jake for at least an hour; when we are , it becomes clear he is a gormless pimple of a man , who is not a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does , whose psychology is purely immitative . the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way . i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen . i thought : good - kill the rebels , end the damned war , let me go home . aggravating this problem is the horrible , horrible dialogue . everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent . i've heard accents from all over the english-speaking world and this is the worst of them all . i do not care if southerners really did talk like that , it is simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours . and believe me , we do listen to it for the full two hours : lee's picture is a talky one , largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical , say-everything-three-times , folksy drawl . it would help if they talked faster , but not much . can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate ? in short : the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life , who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech , who do not bathe often enough , to whom nothing of interest happens , despite their being involved in a war . good points ? jewel was nice to look at , and so was the scenery . but i have complaints even here . the cinematography , nicely framed , looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for jewel , we were teased with her body , but never actually allowed to gaze upon it , which i think is the least we were owed .",0,3
"when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with , a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else . this ova is kinda the opposite . though there're only half a dozen episodes , it is not filled with action , but emotional things . the two main action sequences in this , i believe , are enough to satisfy me . after seeing so many gundam series , movies , and ovas , i was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie . this movie did a fantastic job of that . what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people . it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they are depicted as the second rise of evil nazis . most people that do not like anime that i've forced to watch this movie ( lol ) , liked it . so , i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story . if you are a gundam fan , and have not seen this , you should not be reading this; you should already be watching it right now .",1,9
"i saw a special advance screening of this today . i have to let you know , i'm not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell , so i really had no expectations going into this . i ended up enjoying it quite a bit . dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family . while at a bookstore , he meets the woman of his dreams , only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend . this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack , cinematography , and acting are all top-notch , especially steve carell . my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development , mostly with dane cook's character . we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve's characters , and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan's inner conflict about being in love with dane's girlfriend was like . other than this though , dan in real life is definitely a solid , sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we have been getting this year .",1,7

"the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria ( 1837 to 1901 ) , after having seen in recent years , the efforts with keira knightley's the duchess , cate blanchett's elizabeth films , and scarlett johansson and natalie portman's take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl . more contemporary stories would include helen mirren's award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess diana's death . each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ( ok , so some may dispute johansson ) or were the flavour of their moment , and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured , and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films . however , the young victoria , as the title already suggests , is a lite-version of the young queen's life , and if you are looking for that definitive event , or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady , self-serving politicians , unfortunately there is nothing of depth here . that's not to say the young victoria is without . directed by canadian jean-marc vallee ( best known for crazy ) and written by julian fellowes , this film chronicles in very plain terms , , the life and times of victoria ( emily blunt , soon becoming the new it girl ) when she was a child , the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent ( miranda richardson ) and her adviser sir john conroy ( mark strong ) to appoint themselves as joint-regent to her throne , as already planned for by reigning king william ( jim broadbent ) . as if that was not enough , the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne ( paul bettany ) being a prime minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen , and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace . on one hand you would understand the need for a young , and new queen to have trusted people in key positions , but on the other , are they really acting in her interests , or in the interests of others ? even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert ( rupert friend ) , where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film , and pretty much everything already included in the trailers . for both , they have been brought up under the influence of others , and told each step of the way exactly what to do . even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance , if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding , and to do so with the help of each other . instead of being pawns , there is this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling , and at times absurd , rules and regulations . trust also becomes a much valued commodity , and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean . however , all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative , from childhood to romance , marriage and children . in fact , there is so much fast-forwarding here , especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles , that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more , and room of course for another movie , which i suspect would probably not see the light of day , but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response , and come out with a mini-series or such . it's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes , sets and art direction would be confined to a film that is quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues , that they do not really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary . with its star-studded cast , one would expect more , but one would be left wanting more instead . recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy , only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned .",1,7
"trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality , but these scenes are just rare fragments , picked out to attract audience . they are , of course showing the main message of the movie : people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives , using power , which they may have somewhere else , to notoriously oppress others . and at the low end of the oppression chain , mostly women . a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face , but having to endure such lives , is even tougher . technically the film is much like short cuts , but consisting of documentary style episodes , featuring people like your neighbour , playing just the way they are . without any glitter , and most disturbingly , without any hope . its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing , because you realize , such people are out there , and there are many of them , although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks . somewhere the porn industry has to do its business , somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place , somewhere hopes have to shatter . i sure do know such people . if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes ( some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny , but this happens for real ) and without any melodramatic , go watch this movie . however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear , as subtitles can t transport accentuation .",1,10
"the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list should not have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent . instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that is more lionel 'oliver' blair than brecht . the acting talent is shamefully misused : migenes and walters are good but do not have to try very hard : migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . julia looks perfect as mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . harris's peachum is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious . the adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on marc blitzstein's bowdlerised broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what is been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . and the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement vittorio storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . disgraceful .",0,2
"another one of those films you hear about from friends ( . . . or read about on imdb ) . not many false notes in this one . i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida , with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car . the heroine , ruby , makes some false starts , but learns from them . i found myself wondering why , why did not she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder , but . . . she has her reasons , as it turns out . just a fine film . the only thing i do not much like about it , i think , is the title .",1,10
"the priyadarshan/paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie ( at an indian multiplex ) with high hopes , especially after the slick promos . unfortunately , like hulchul before it , this movie was a huge disappointment . like others have commented , the premise of the movie , which was already stale to begin with , just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering . after a while , you just want the movie to end so you can go home ( if i had been watching this at home , it would have been much easier to cut my losses ) . akshay kumar's performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again . the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week . i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie . definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana . paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments , but overall , because his role and character was not given much room to grow , he did not make much of an impact in this film . neha dhupia , who makes only an appearance in the movie , was fun to look at while she was on screen . and some of the songs are fun . especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby , respectively . otherwise , you are better off just passing on this movie .",0,4
"my mother worked with dennis l . raider for eleven years , not to mention shared an office with him . when it was announced he was btk , she was shocked . the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the wichita killer . i've heard her re-tell them many times . i've inquired her about a lot of things , and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to . i've read the entire book written about raider , wichita is my hometown and i was surprised that such a thing could happen in kansas . there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago , and i thought this one would have been better at portraying dennis' killings , maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives . i'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie . this is based on my mom's portrayal of him , all my readings on him , and the video tapes i've seen of him talking . first of all , the camera angles were horrible . it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera . the acting was terrible and i could not even bear to watch it . dennis raider never had long hair . dennis raider was a ""very anal man"" and was a ""follow the rule book"" kind of guy . he was not as nice as the movie made him look , he was very polite and abrupt , business like . same goes for his killings , as far as we all know . if you have seen his confession in court , you can already guess . and as for the obsession with the slaughter house ? no . never have i read or has dennis raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs . in fact , he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods . yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them . dennis raider never killed the people that he knew , he confessed this , but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also . i really do not even want to go in to this movie , and i'm already ranting . this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk . this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie . if you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes served the side , then this is your kind of movie .",0,1
"i thought this movie was stunning , with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi ( artemisia gentileschi ) . cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully , with tentative yet confidant mannerisms , her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place . the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch . although not each character was overtly beautiful , this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time . overall i thought this film was fantastic .",1,10
"simply the best estonian film that i have ever seen , although it is made by a finnish director ilkka j rvi-laturi . tallin pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold , a national treasure that belongs to the republic of estonia . but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time . in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries , such as estonia , became independent . now the conditions may be better in most of those countries . but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance . ( and many of them still do . . . at least on some level . . . ) tallinn pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script . the actors are also very good , especially j ri j rvet ( perhaps the best known estonian actor , plays snaut in tarkovski's solaris ) , playing and old gangster who is slowly becoming tired of his way of life . but the most astonishing performance comes from monika m ger , a child-actor playing terje , a boyish girl in her early teens , whose presence in the plot is quite essential . ( and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb-credit list ! ! ! ) w there are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time . but tallinn pimeduses does that . unfortenately j rvi-laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements . his first one , kotia p in was too artificial and his latest , history is made at night was just a weird mess .",1,10

"when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film , i was intrigued . being a fan of the book , i assumed she would be playing tony , roz , or charis , but more so , i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y , almost psychological ( but not psychological thriller ) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who had not read the novel , and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . the book is a complex reflection of society , women , and modern life , and i was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . what they actually did was a crime . the biggest error and confusing issue is : why would oxygen , a network that advertises as being for women , take an amazing book about how complex , wonderful , and terrible women are and can be , and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story ? it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz , tony , and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that , they rushed through bulk of the book . in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it , aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . in the film , these women are not people , they are characters . in the book zenia does fake her death , but the book mentions it to get this point across , while the film wastes 30-45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi . it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia , which was so wrong . zenia is a catherine zeta-jones , angelina jolie , or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type . she is a woman men cannot not adore , and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by , but in a ""keep your enemies closer"" kind of way . and once she gets closer , she seems totally genuine and trust worthy , despite your better judgment . she is the kind of woman who , even when she loses , she wins : she is always still beautiful , still rich , and there are always still people out there who do not know her game . in the film , zenia did not take charis's man ( the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place . . . ) but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian ( and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies ) . and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august , but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . it's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book , but i think had i not read the book , i would have spent the whole movie confused , if i had bothered to stick with it at all . and roz's husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture ( which was weird since zenia took roz's business and home life in the book , which is why roz hated her so much ) and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz's husband years and years back . and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever . . . even at the party where zenia and west ( in the book ) had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it ( and evil , bitchy ) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . tony's character was so wrong in this film . . . she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky , mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . the film basically implied smart women are evil , beautiful women are evil , powerful women are evil , and women who teach yoga are off their rockers . they basically tried to make it so zenia was not necessarily as awful as she was in the book , and then , in the end , the three women convince this former cop ( who , of course in the process of researching this , meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous , which of course zenia bails on ) to hide zenia's body ( which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at , but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony , or they conspired together to do it . . . ) and then zenia also managed to take all of roz's money in the process . by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b/c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been . if you are not confused by this breakdown of the film , then maybe you would like it , because i have read the book and seen the movie , and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused . it was terrible . i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task , but if you are going to take on the task , you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary , instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland . are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of ?",0,1

"after watching two of his silent shorts , 'elena and her men ( 1956 ) ' is my first feature-length film from french director jean renoir , and i quite enjoyed it . however , i did not watch the film for renoir , but for star ingrid bergman , who at age 41 still radiated unsurpassed beauty , elegance and charm . throughout the early 1950s , following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini , bergman temporarily fell out of public favour . her next five films , directed by her husband , were unsuccessful in the united states , and i suspect that renoir's latest release did little to enhance bergman's popularity with english-speaking audiences {however , she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year's 'anastasia ( 1956 ) '} . she stars as elena sokorowska , a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts , bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere , before promptly abandoning them . while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan ( jean marais ) , she finds herself falling into a love that she will not be able to walk away from . this vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy , as long as you do not take it too seriously; it is purely lighthearted romantic fluff . filmed in vibrant technicolor , 'elena and her men' looks terrific as well , a flurry of bright colours , characters and costumes . bergman's polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed , not in an unlikable way , but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions . she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d' tat , knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a ""guardian angel . "" perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt ( mel ferrer , then audrey hepburn's husband ) , who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love , and love alone . this , renoir proudly suggests , is what the true french do best . 'elena and her men' also attempts , with moderate success , to expose the superficiality of upper-class french liaisons , through the clumsy philandering of eug ne ( jacques jouanneau ) , who cannot make love to his servant mistress without his fianc walking in on them . for these sequences , renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film , but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just is not there .",1,7

"come on , what is the deal with this show , power rangers anyways ? i always felt that the show , which was originally brought over from japan in a better form , took what was great in japan , and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history ! there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever . the bad haircuts , bad costumes , earrings , etc , all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots , bulk and skull , to the ""duhs"" , of the main cast , jason , trini , tommy , kimberly , billy and zack , i just want to say one thing : give me a break ! saban brought this from japan , and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago . now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such . all i can say once again is give me a break !",0,1
"one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr . blandings builds his dream house . although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today . still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham . what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years . returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans . the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand . around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft-ellender- wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business . i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties . like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester . their place was not quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms , still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did . of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up , threatening to send cary to the cleaners . cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel , usually too late . truth be told he is kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it . myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles . if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does , the film would still work just fine . mr . blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal . and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years .",1,8

"this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it is not his best . body double , the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession . de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho . angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist , played by michael caine , turns down an offer , dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him . after this point it is best you do not know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer . dennis franz is the detective on the case who really does not trust allen and she has to find the killer herself . it's a pretty good movie but is not one of de palma's best .",1,7
"***spoilers*** with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean , john carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune , some 140 million dollars . the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion . there seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it is really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise . the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia , rodolfo acosta . acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests . later that evening cute little chin greg and laura's , jeff morrow & marry anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond . the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it is revealed who the killer really is . we then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest . the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot . nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking . there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s&m sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder . you just could not care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do . even the big surprise at the end is not really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! we then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is . the final plot-twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie .",0,3

"" amazing . to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history . the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english/linear pcm stereo , were as in the states , i think , you can get it with 5 . 1 at least , ""check local press for details "" on that , okay . the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras , which is a disappointment . yes , for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play , for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be , live , raw and in your face ! i would have given this dvd ten if it was not for the lack of 5 . 1 , and some extras would have been nice . thanks roger , pete , john and keith .",1,9
"steve carell plays dan burns , newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls . at a large family homecoming dan meets his perfect woman , only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother . what's a man to do ? i rather liked ""dan in real life"" , but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained , rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful . if you cannot accept it , fear not , ""get smart"" will be along later in the year , but for the record i thought he was very good . ""dan in real life"" starts off like your typical , incidentally amusing , family drama , but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and carell's frustration with his situation grows . it's not massively original ( but if you only saw movies with original ideas , cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed , would not they ? ) , but ""dan in real life"" is entertaining , and a good cast ( who would not fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche ? ) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love . i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again .",1,7

"casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance . cassidy personified arrogance , confidence , charm and wit - all with a condescending , evil little smirk on his face . in my opinion , jack cassidy is by far the best murderer ( having appeared three times ) in the columbo series . this particular ( and first ) performance , is my favorite columbo episode ever - hands down . a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work ( yes , there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times ) capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin . also , the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake , ca ( franklin's cabin home ) were very impressive . if you have not yet seen this episode , then you owe it to yourself to do so - it is a true masterpiece . jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer . his charismatic personality was highly infectious . his death in 1976 , at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him . rest in peace jack , you will live on for eternity through your great work .",1,10

"i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it . game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film . he failed thank god . the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin will not like her because she is ugly . the film is just bad for so many reasons . the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits : ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit . those two scenes made me cringe ! janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant ( and guessing from her role as stand-up ""comedienne"" and arch-feminist is in real life too ) . she claims that the film is ""anti-feminist"" when in fact it is just realistic . men more often than not go for looks over personality . it's interesting to note her hypocrisy too . she would been a feminist and ""comedienne"" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad . i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film . i mean come on ! she acted in it for heaven's sake ! what this film was really was anti-men if anything . it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman's character noelle . there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin's character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure . is that the best the script writers could come up with ? blimey they have never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made . there's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is . the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo is not ugly but is actually beautiful . erm was i watching the same film as they were ? she is certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one . although having said that , i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well : she is lanky and gaunt looking . i guarantee three things about this film if you have never watched it : you will know what the ending will be; you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and; you will be bored after ten minutes . watch at your own peril .",0,2
"( various spoilers follow ) gene kelly . not georges guetary , who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un-french . not leslie caron , who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance . not even oscar levant , who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me . no , it would definitely be gene kelly . there's something about his screen persona that is too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in paris , content to put off facing the critics indefinitely , frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets . that's what made him so effective in singin' in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious , focused characters . jerry mulligan is in some ways a cousin to tommy albright in brigadoon , another lerner story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque european place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues . except that jerry is not as likeable as even poor dazed tommy . that's another galling thing about this film . jerry is sometimes a cad to milo , and even worse to lise . when he first sees the latter at a club , he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him . when she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number . when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him , which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace . and throughout all this it is obvious she wants nothing to do with him . when she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop , it is about as believable as milo's interest in his paintings . sure he is good-looking and playful , but why should that sway her when she is got henri , who seems like a gentleman to boot ? admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress . if a role like lise was played by , say , judy garland , she would shower jerry with indignant insults and glares . if she was played by cyd charisse , one would admire his guts . but when she is played by first-timer leslie caron she looks and acts like a shy , vulnerable teenager , and as a result jerry just seems like a creep . and why did they choose these other actors ( though personally i'd rather they would solved things by changing the lead ) when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people ? not only is gene kelly a few years above guetary and foch , he is old enough to be caron's father . in short i think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic-relief type dancer as jerry , the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles . . . e . g . ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl . maybe not them necessarily but someone like them . someone who could have chased lise and made it seem harmlessly playful; someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that chaplinesque hole-in-the-wall; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with oscar levant's sarcastic grumpiness . it probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous . and it might have provided a voice that could sing gershwin better . all this may give the impression that i do not like gene kelly . i do like him . he was terrific in most of his films , just not this one ( well , and a few others ) . i do not despise aaip itself , either; it has good points , like the art direction . and leslie caron , who despite her inexperience is rather charming , and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting . georges guetary does a fine job and his ""stairway to paradise"" is my favorite number in the movie . nina foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody . but not jerry mulligan . i would not wish that on her .",0,1

". . . . as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates . barely even reaching feature length , ""can i do it . . . . 'till i need glasses"" is a collection of ( mostly ) dirty jokes . many of them are so short that you cannot believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline ( example : the santa claus gag ) ; others are so long that you cannot believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline ( example : the students' awards gag ) . and nearly all are directed without any artistry . don't get me wrong : about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny ( the iron / phone one is probably my favorite ) . there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves , yet again , that the female body , especially in its natural form , is the best thing on this planet ( there is some comedic male nudity as well ) . and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy ! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4 .",0,3
"i do not what that other review was talking about . this definitely is not a bimbo movie , in fact , i do not think there was one decent looking girl in it . no , it is just cheesy , poorly-done , ed wood-style science fiction schlock . and it is bad . i cannot even begin to tell you how bad it is . i saw it late at night on cable , and i was in shock . the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all . the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded , the special effects are a joke , and the pace is insanely slow . to me though , the music tops it all . a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone . do not rent this thing , but if you ever see it on cable , watch it . you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be .",0,1
"forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 ( so many 2s ) game . like most video game turned movies , i would say the majority do not translate into a different medium really well . and that goes for this one too , painfully . there's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story , and the mysterious island on which a writer ( leo morimoto ) and his children , daughter yuki ( yui ichikawa ) and son hideo ( jun nishiyama ) come to move into . the villagers do not look all too friendly , and soon enough , sound advice is given about the siren on the island , to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing . naturally and slowly , things start to go bump , and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants . but in truth , you will not bother with what is going on , as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more . what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill-placed-out-of-the-norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity , until it is explained much later . it's one thing trying to come up and present something smart , but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered . despite it clocking in under 90 minutes - i think it is a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to . things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes , but it is a classic case of too little too late . what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end . again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience . it turned out rather satisfactorily , but leaves a bad aftertaste as you will feel cheated somewhat . there are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level , or provides you with that hokey feeling . unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter . the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light , shadows and mirrors , but i will be that explicit - it is still not worth the time , so better to avoid this .",0,2
"gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime . a bit slow moving ( especially around the middle of the series ) , but over all enjoyable . now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a ""winger"" , i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam , gundam 0080 and 0083 , the 08th ms team , and gundam seed . i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be ""rip-offs"" ( i . e . zechs marquise to the original gundam's char ) , but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series , as is seed . if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first , and then know that you are watching an au series .",1,9
"i just saw ""valentine"" and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years . unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks , this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking . for those out there that hated ""scream , "" there is not one reference to ""the horror rules"" in this movie ( even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here ) . this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror . you get the style , cinematography , and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick . i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for . this is definitely a move in the right direction . denise richards stands out here as a fun character . you can tell she liked her role , and that makes her stand out . i loved her in this movie .",1,10
"friz freleng's 'speedy gonzalez' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert mckimson's 'cat-tails for two' . in that cartoon , speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted . despite looking significantly more handsome , speedy never developed into much of a character . a big hat , tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that is pretty much all speedy ever had going for him . nevertheless , the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days . while these early speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently ( rather oddly ) paired up with daffy duck , they still leave much to be desired , relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula . in this self-titled episode , speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat . although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon , sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat . his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable . undemanding role of pursuer . this was always a problem in the tweety cartoons too but speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture . poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many years to come . despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs , 'speedy gonzalez' won an oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born .",0,3
"this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate . it has good acting , lots of gore , and a decent plot . one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead . it's obvious that the budget was not all that big , but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors , which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects-filled films . the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work . there are no wasted scenes , so the film's length is a bit short . in addition , it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel , which would be very interesting as well . so grab some popcorn , turn down the lights and enjoy this one .",1,9
"i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact . while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one , its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode , along with the uncovering of the murderer . the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless . at one point , gordon , playing a famous writer , makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt . columbo , making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime-solver . this is one of the best of many great columbo installments .",1,8
"mcconaughey in a horror/thriller ? i had to see this . i was pleasantly surprised . the plot is told in flashback mode , and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament . i cannot say much more without spoiling the whole movie , sorry . just know that if you decide to watch it , you will be , in the very least , surprised . all the main players are very good . bill paxton did a great job directing those kids , and his acting is awesome . mcconaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly . this movie challenges you to think . is dad crazy ? is there a god ? do demons exist ? how far would you go to right a wrong . and what is ""right"" anyway ? i'm still thinking . and thus i recommend ""frailty"" . 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second , or even third viewing .",1,7
"i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight . it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . the plot had potential ( who would not love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets ? ) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he is going to return , then a group of stars moves together to form an ""elvis"" constellation , which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators , sending them crashing through the roof . bad . . . really bad . which is the theme for the whole movie . i'd avoid this one at all costs .",0,4
"the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house , good effects work and sound work , a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house . there are scenes that make you jump , and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past , i found interesting . there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . jerry goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . what i wish could have happened is for something a little more intense . jan de bont had a pg-13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much . poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago , and it still holds up . the haunting could have used a few more scenes of pure terror . the ending was for me , a little anticlimactic . overall , i enjoyed it . the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump . i just wish it scared me more .",1,7
"really , everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else ! no wonder , the casting is done not with the left hand , but rather not at all . i have not seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent , carrying a gun . you do not use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role . the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute . the rest of the cast is likewise awful , possibly with hurt as the sole exception , sometimes you can see him trying , but suffering . oh , did i mention that it is a completely insane story ? jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family ? well , it must be because the guy ( weller ) is german ? 2/10 , because the photography could be worse .",0,2
"the premise of the film is that thomas archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when ( after post traumatic stress disorder therapy ) , he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit . he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution : drills , bats , nails , sledgehammers , torches , whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being . we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime . the two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why . well , when all is said and done , we do not really care . . .",0,2
"everyone has a first love , and though it is hard to define that feeling when you are younger , it is there , aching inside you . that is what malaysian filmmaker yasmin ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature , a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple , straightforward fashion . such an approach is especially convenient in this case , as the love story at the film's core involves two twelve-year olds , and would therefore make any attempts at ""deeper"" analysis seem contrived and pretentious . that they do not is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non-actors , sharifah aryana and mohd syafie naswip . the former plays orked ( already seen as an adult character in ahmad's previous picture , gubra ) , a lively , almost rebellious girl who , perhaps influenced by her ""british"" upbringing ( her mother studied in england ) , despises playing with dolls , preferring to play violent sports with the boys . then one day she meets mukhsin ( naswip ) , who has come to spend the holidays at his aunt's house , and all of a sudden she changes her habits : goodbye fistfights , hello bike-riding and tree-climbing . but what does this mean ? are they just friends , or is something more implied , something neither of them is yet ready to understand , let alone accept ? given the young age of the protagonists , answering those questions borders on impossible , and so , like in several ""smaller"" films ( lost in translation comes to mind ) , there is no real closure , a choice that leaves a bittersweet , but ultimately satisfying aftertaste : the naturalistic , unfiltered acting ( especially aryana's ) gets to the heart almost immediately , and a strong supporting cast ( orked's family most of all ) helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing . the down-to-earth approach is not always that effective ( the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early ) , and it is hard to justify the bizarre pulp fiction reference at the start of the feature , but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent asian cinema .",1,8
"i commend pictures that try something different . many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas , so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico . the movie is set just after ww2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners ""barmy"" . the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico . they , too , are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it . that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago ! with this document , they reason , they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want , since it turns out they really aren't british subjects ! where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you will need to see for yourselves . leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem !",1,9
"this is a typical low budget 1970's mess . it's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific northwest . every character is a stereotype , from the native american to the cynical cowboy . the acting and narration are a complete joke . if you are hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage - keep hoping . there will not be much , and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it would look better than this movie . it's not that i do not like 1970's low budge fare; i do . it's that this is such a mess of bad acting , bad characters , lousy story and no thrills that you just cannot enjoy it . it does not fit into the ""so bad it is good"" category , nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances . it's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping , hiking , riding horses , and watching wild life . there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid; supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him . by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing .",0,1
"this film is awful . the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi . the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge . the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive . it is mostly a photo-shopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen . this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed , and i have seen lots of the very bad sci-fi channel movies . aside from the terrible lack of special effects , the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters/waitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks . perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building ( and crushing kate ) the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water . no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects . at least there is honor among crocodiles .",0,1
"well its about time . i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries . while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries , at least this episode turned out well . its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season . in ""right to die"" we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey . at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation . abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back . while they speak , they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises , but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire . and this is just the setup people . once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes . there's also a side effect too . every time she flatlines , abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people . hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever . from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it , right to die should have the right to go on living forever .",1,8
"the sopranos ( 1999-2007 ) number 1 - television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would not go past a pilot episode . the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time . james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss , tony soprano , accompanied by a stellar cast . edie falco is superb as the worrying , loving upper-middle class mother; tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious , greying consiglieri who is often very funny . while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian-americans as mafiosi , and to an extent this is undeniable , i can see so many positives from the show . the portrayal of strong family values , friendships , love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters ? yes . furthermore , other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism , social inequality and injustice , homosexuality , drugs etc . this is no shallow , dull show about tough guys and violence . it has so much more . many of the issues we see on the show are very real . the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives , which makes the whole thing more interesting . credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini , for envisioning , television's most complex and enigmatic character . simply exceptional . 10/10",1,10
"at the height of the 'celebrity big brother' racism row in 2007 ( involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody ) , i condemned on an internet forum those 'c . b . b . ' fans who praised the show , after years of bashing 'racist' '70's sitcoms such as 'curry & chips' & 'love thy neighbour' . i thought they were being hypocritical , and said so . 'it ain't half hot mum' was then thrown into the argument , with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blacked-up . well , yes , but michael bates had lived in india as a boy , and spoke urdu fluently . the show is detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'rangi ram' . the noted indian character actor , renu setna , said in a 1995 documentary 'perry & croft : the sitcoms' that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role , but added : ""no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates . "" . indeed . 'mum' was perry and croft's companion show to 'dad's army'; also set in wartime , the sedate english town of walmington-on-sea had been replaced by the hot , steamy jungles of india , in particularly a place called deolali , where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops , among them bombadier solomons ( george layton , his first sitcom role since 'doctor in charge' ) , camp gunner 'gloria' beaumont ( melvyn hayes ) , diminutive gunner 'lofty' sugden , 'lah de-dah' gunner graham ( john clegg ) , and gunner parkins ( the late christopher mitchell ) . presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeant-major williams ( the brilliant windsor davies ) , who regarded them all as 'poofs' . his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to parkins , whom he thought was his illegitimate son ! ) . then there was ever-so english colonel reynolds ( donald hewlett ) and dimwitted captain ashwood ( michael knowles ) . rangi was like a wise old sage , beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs . he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british . his friends were the tea-making char wallah ( the late dino shafeek , who went on to 'mind your language' ) and the rope pulling punka wallah ( babar bhatti ) . so real indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore . shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions' ( similar to the '40's songs used as incidental music on 'dad's army' ) . each edition closed with him warbling 'land of hope & glory' only to be silenced by a 'shut up ! ' from williams . the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner . though never quite equalling 'dad's army' in the public's affections , 'mum' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons . in 1975 , davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'whispering grass' . they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts , entitled ( what else ? ) 'sing lofty ! ' . the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer . rather than recast the role of 'rangi' , the writers just let him be quietly forgotten . when george layton left , the character of 'gloria' took his place as 'bombadier' , providing another source of comedy . the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty , the char wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ) . repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on u . k . gold ) all because of its so-called 'dodgy' reputation . this is strange . for one thing , the show was not specifically about racism . if a white man blacked-up is so wrong , why does david lean's 1984 film 'a passage to india' still get shown on television ? ( it featured alec guinness as an indian , and won two oscars ! ) . it was derived from jimmy perry's own experiences . some characters were based on real people ( the sergeant-major really did refer to his men as 'poofs' ) . i take the view that if you are going to put history on television , get it right . sanitizing the past , no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences , is fundamentally dishonest . 'mum' was both funny and truthful , and viewers saw this . thank heavens for d . v . d . 's i say . time to stop this review . as williams would say : ""i'll have no gossiping in this jungle !

"*wonderland spoilers* july 1st , 1981 : five people , ron launius ( josh lucas ) , susan launius ( christina applegate ) , billy deverell ( tim blake nelson ) , barbara richardson ( natasha gregson wagner ) and joy miller ( janeane garofalo ) are attacked while they are asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at 8763 wonderland avenue , laurel canyon , la . only susan survives . main suspect : john holmes ( val kilmer ) , former king of porn , owner of a 30 cm long dick , and now a hopeless addict . two investigators , luis ( frankie g . ) and sam nico ( ted levine ) , are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that john at the very least took part in the murders , david lind ( dylan mcdermott ) , barbara's boyfriend , and trying to get a witness report out of dawn schiller ( kate bosworth ) , holmes' 19-year-old girlfriend and from susan , who sadly does not remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate , and the name of eddie nash ( eric bogosian ) , a major drug kingpin ( who is always around ladies such as barbie ( paris hilton ) ) , comes into light as a suspect planner of the wonderland massacre . but what did happen that night ? and could sharon ( lisa kudrow ) , john's wife , know something about it ? 'wonderland' is a taught , intense thriller , a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the 'rashomon' technique ( we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of david , john , dawn , susan ( albeit very briefly ) and sharon ) , a nice direction and a great script , but is mostly compelling for the performances , especially kilmer's , who takes central stage with his hopeless , tormented , sometimes childish holmes , lucas' , whose launius is strangely alluring , kudrow's strong sharon and bosworth's innocent dawn . wonderland : 9/10 .",1,9
"i have been a fan of this movie for years and years . because of teri hatchers move into the forefront , i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it . why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me ? sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous . although i never have watching daytime soap operas , this movie kills me every time i watch it . the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart . i highly recommend that you watch this if you have not already . you will get to see elizabeth shue , whoopi goldberg , teri hatcher , and carrie fisher . . . to name a few . . . all give splendid performances .",1,10

"when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television . we've all been guilty of it at some time or another , but my excuse for watching things like ""buck rogers in the 25th century"" and ""silver spoons"" is this : i was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile . thankfully , i now appreciate the good stuff . stargate sg-1 is not good . the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it , every line of stilted dialogue , every bit of needless technobabble . the writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek : voyager . if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever , you are in trouble . the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure , anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell , full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture , a wonderful musical score , and cool sci-fi ideas . with the exception of a little of the original music , none of what made the film fun appears in this show . even richard dean anderson , who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting , seems like he is half asleep most episodes . the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement . the cinematography is not much better , as vanilla and dull as the scripts . it amazes me that shows with a lot more style ( like farscape ) and substance ( like the reimagined battlestar galactica ) have smaller , less rabid fanbases than this pap . it just does not deserve it .",0,2
"the comparison is perhaps unfair , but inevitable . those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the american style - awkward , stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers . gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor , that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted ( as you will remember , the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas ) . the translation of the french ( for subtitled versions ) , as well , leaves something to be desired , although this cannot be attributed to demy . the film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting , such as references in songs to legrand himself . and the costumes - well , the tight pants/white boots combination , and the freakishly unnatural colors , reminds one of an austin powers film . . . but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; note , for instance , the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg . also , note the ""convenient brunette of resolution"" - madeleine in umbrellas , and josette in young girls . generally speaking , those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas ( save the floating bicycle scene ) , or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script , should probably pass this one b y . those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy .",0,4

"halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever ! john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful , creepy , and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller . michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators , such as jason vorhees ( friday the 13th ) , the miner ( my bloody valentine ) , and charlie puckett ( the night brings charlie ) . okay , so i got a little obscure there , but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre . no longer did a monster have to come from king tut's tomb or from dr . frankenstein's lab . he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia . and on the night he came home . . . haddonfield , illinois and the viewers would never be the same . there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies . first is the setting . . . it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood . many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters . this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe , but if trouble starts to brew , nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved ( especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine . ) along with the setting , the movie takes place on halloween ! ! the scariest night of the year ! while most people are carving jack-o-lanterns , michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers . besides the setting , there is some great acting . jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine , laurie strode , a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date . however , it is donald pleasance , as dr . sam loomis , who really steals the show . his portrayal of the good doctor , who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all , is the stuff of horror legend . however , it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film . once you hear it , you will never forget it . i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture . nowadays , they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie , giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of . in halloween , john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers . he always seems like he is a part of the shadows , and , i think that is what makes him so terrifying . there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens ( unbeknownst to them ) , which adds to his creepiness . if you think about , some wacko could be watching you right now and you would not even know it . unfortunately for our teenagers ( and fortunately for us horror fans ) , when they find michael , he is not looking for candy on this halloween night . . he is looking for blood . finally , michael myers , himself , is a key element to this movie's effectiveness . his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop . he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life . so , if you have not seen this movie ( if there are still some of you out there who have not , or even if you have ) , grab some popcorn , turn off every light , pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright . trick or treat !",1,10
"the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie , but wait ! there's more ! this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv , movie stars on the way down , ( and up ) and the horrors of love . robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius , and cathy moriarty is splendid . the dialogue is witty , and the physical humor done with consummate skill . this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting , directing , and writing .",1,10

"the internet database lists this as a tv show . and yes , it was a series on mtv shown on the ""oddities"" program , after ""the head"" and before ""aeon flux"" if i recall correctly . but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes . you have the story of the maxx , julie winters , sarah and mr . gone . the maxx is a super-hero or a bum , julie a social worker or a leopard queen , sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr . gone a guy who cannot seem to keep his head on . and then there is the other weird creatures . . . i use ""or"" with maxx and julie , because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams . maybe they are all real or dreams . maybe one of the characters does not exist . maybe only one exists and dreams of the others . you'll have to wait and find out . i had the comic books before the show came out , and it was one of my favorites . the artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you will find in superman or batman . it will bend your mind , and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive . and the show used basically the same exact artwork ( only now it moves ) and the same story . . . guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced . this was the best show to appear on ""oddities"" , hands down . if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip , this is a show to check out . it's ""donnie darko"" before there was ever such a thing . the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series , but i do not say this in disappointment . by keeping it simple , they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures .",1,10
"well , how do you even rate a movie such as this one ? does it even have cinematic value really ? it's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible . basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl . not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really . it's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible . however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended . the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking , as well as sounding . they are often just kicking into the floor , rather than into the girl , obviously . also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame . i mean if this was real , surely she would had screamed it out . there is more moaning than screaming in this one though . the movie is obviously low budget and it is a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking , with very limited resources . don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released , though it must had done something well , since a total of six sequels got released after this one . fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie , though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie . 4/10",0,4

"any way the wind blows is tom barmans ( who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'deus' ) debut movie . entirely shot in antwerp ( belgium ) , the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters . when the movie ends , you have a lot of stuff to think about , because most of the different story-lines are left wide open . the movie has a ( purely instrumental ) sound track that will rock your socks off . in most scenes , the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel , really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time . the main scene in the film , the party , is very well shot . the director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques , having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately . the screenplay is great stuff . camera angles and colors are very well chosen . the 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too . and i loved ( most of the ) acting . the thing i liked most about the movie , are the subtle touches of absurd , surreal , very dry or even cynical humor that interleave . without claiming to be a comedy ( this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art ) , it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times . this is one more directors' debut that should not be an ending . i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time . cheers .",1,9

"leave it to geniuses like ventura pons , the spanish director , to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film . the sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material . most of the pictures that are made in spain fall under two categories : those about the spanish civil war , that love to present past history as the writers deem fit . the other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the 'creators' do not have anything interest to say . as the film opens we get to watch pere's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party . later on , sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire . the story of pere's attraction to sandra , a married woman that seems to be happily married , is false from the start . our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier , better made picture by mr . pons , ""amic/amat"" , but alas , it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture . as far as the comments submitted in imdb , all the negative votes come from spanish viewers , which speaks volumes coming from them !",0,1

"once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie . it uses many of the tropes of the genre : the sinister apartment , suspicious neighbors , apparitions , mysteries , hallucinations . the life of the hero , trelkovsky , seemed surrounded by evil , secret forces trying to drive him mad . last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation . if this movie is a horror movie , it is only horror in the sense that a kafka novel is horror . in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence . polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness : repulsion , which i do not particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me; rosemary's baby , in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces; and the tenant , which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema . trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself . he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her : he wears her clothes , puts on makeup , talks like her . but is he being possessed by a spirit , or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him ? it's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary , and which polanski never resolves , that makes this such a fascinating movie . many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes , and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe in . although this is not my favorite polanski movie , it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms . and technically speaking , it is a marvel too . suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist ( bergman's dp ) in the making of this movie . a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy , but it is an experience nevertheless .",1,7

"" aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on . i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms . jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john . my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant . the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which i feel are appropriate , given the circumstances .",1,10
"he now has a name , an identity , some memories and a a lost girlfriend . all he wanted was to disappear , but still , they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built . now he wants some explanation , and to get ride of the people how made him what he is . yeah , jason bourne is back , and this time , he 's here with a vengeance . ok , this movie does not have the most elaborated script in the world , but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society . of course , like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's , ""the bourne suprematy"" is a super-heroes story . jason bourne is a captain-america project-like , who is gone completely wrong . in the first movie , the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one . he now fights against what he considers like evil , after a person close to him has been killed ( his girlfriend in ""suprematy"" ) by them . that's all a part of the super-hero story , including a character with ( realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible ) super powers . and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world ( there is no frontiers in the bourne's movies , characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye ) , is , as in the best seasons of ""24"" , an american enemy , who is beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him . funny how ""mad patriots"" are now the n . 1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories . beside all those interesting thematics , the movie is not flawless : the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes . but all that does not really matter , for ""the bourne ultimatum"" is an action movie . and the action scenes are rather impressive . everyone here is talking about the ""waterloo scene"" and the ""tanger pursuit"" and everyone's right . i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger , that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark . visually inventive scenes , lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics : ""the bourne ultimatum"" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick .",1,7

"it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore , maybe to the mediocreland ? ""pp"" reminds me any one of the many tedious , promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks ( picket fences , ally mcbeal , and now boston legal ) . the crazy cases they get are so outlandish , they barely evoke sympathy or sadness . and that is what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of , ""this could be me"" sentiment . they are not funny either . the actors are quite good , but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live . i'm a therapist , and let me tell you - amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent , unethical , untrained therapist . whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in stanford . somebody should give them a code of ethics to read ( the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it ) . no therapists are that bad . women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death , we have all graduated ""sex and the city"" . addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate , looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 , and this otherwise talented actress does not believe it herself and does not deliver it very well . the only successful/palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la , and the ""voodoo dr"" and his coping with widowhood . this concept might work with a whole new writing team .",0,4
"this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies . the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place , where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious . he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha , who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark . luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off . adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo , who was frozen alive at the end of episode v , jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside . but all of the star wars ""good guys"" , especially r2-d2 , had other ideas . . . and those other ideas fended off luke's execution; in the end , most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death . like in episode iv , the death star in episode vi makes its appearance . as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star , the star destroyer personnel , i guessed , sped up the arming of the main laser , using the imperial fighters as a diversion . the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise . once it fired , the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out , and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he could not until the shield was taken out . and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience . like in episode v , the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons , killing at least one of the ewoks . . . but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them . for instance , chewbacca , as well as another ewok , was able to commandeer one of the walkers ( and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers ) , and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers . it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre , like , for instance , the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike , and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike . or , in a climax , using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader . you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown , complete with a short display of fireworks , drumming on the spoils of victory ( e . g . , storm trooper masks ) , and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader , now dead , is burned on a pyre . the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer john williams . on the home movie version , i think lucas himself wanted a different ending . in addition to the celebration on endor , he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets , including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith . the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece . he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction , balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies .",1,10

"i have heard a lot about this film , with people writing me telling me i should see it , as i am a fan of extremely bloody , gory movies . i got my hands on it almost right away , but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now . i would have been better off not remembering i even had it . this movie was atrocious . the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was . i know it was a story by clive barker and all , and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you have not then you will be , as i was , completely clueless and utterly disappointed . the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing , the story interesting . the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention . i thought the blood looked a bit bad , but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on . i was wrong . the blood and effects are so horrible , it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that , for instance , someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer . wtf ? cgi blood ( did they even use any ""real"" blood at all ? my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film ! ) , unbelievable acts of dismemberment ( eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies ? ! ) , too-dark scenes ( every scene is either an odd yellow color , or in hidden in shadows ) . . . it just gets worse and worse . i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake . there's just too much . add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end . . . no thank you ! it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok , with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer . maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant ? plausible , doable . . . and a lot better i think than the ""real"" story . that could have and should have worked . instead it became a ""creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you , and unless you read the book , well . . . you just will not ever understand it"" fiasco . tragic , what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential . if you like mindless fake blood and gore , you will love this . but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it . stay away- far , far away .",0,1
"just what we need ! another remake of vintage hollywood cinema , with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor ( 1996 ) ! this shows why we are running out of special ideas in making a quality movie , ladies and gentlemen ! it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans . things can only get more worse , unfortunately . bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of ""family"" funfare instantly . even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel , which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater . sad to say this is the more progressive pre-millennium era , but enjoy it while it lasts because things can only get worse with time . more went wrong with the all-new dr . dolittle . it is absolutely plotless , feeling too flat . i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock ! ! ! we need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who do not want to declare bankruptcy . i'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 . then again , the original version was not any good , either . murphy's next project could be patton if he is not careful !",0,3

"as it is often the case , the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories . similar to unleashed ( which was great , ) dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding . the main characters , an emotionally undeveloped , amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer , are far from the common heroes and villains we often see . in fact , by the end , you lose track of who you are supposed to empathize with , failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide . although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability , by the half-way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge . the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling . and in the end , you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary . on the plus side , the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies so those who are not familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out . the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film . it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten . maybe i'm the only one , but it strained my eyes . the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget , low speed chase scene . and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy , you realize that it is not an ending at all , but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity . throw in some grisly from-behind choke scenes , a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way , asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that did not match the film , and you get the average bland asian thriller . i just do not get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ? ultimately , in the end , we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us tetanus . 4/10",0,4

"no-nonsense inspector hollaway ( a solid turn by john bennett ) investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house . first and most mundane tale , ""method for murder"" - successful author charles hillyer ( nicely played by denholm elliott ) is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he is writing about in his latest book . although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special , it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending . second and most poignant anecdote , ""waxworks"" - lonely philip grayson ( the always outstanding peter cushing ) and his equally lonesome friend neville rogers ( the splendid joss ackland ) both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful , but lethal murderess . third and most chilling vignette , ""sweets to the sweet"" - quiet , reserved and secretive widower john reid ( a typically terrific christopher lee in a rare semi-sympathetic role ) hires nanny ann norton ( the fine nyree dawn porter ) to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter jane ( a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable chloe franks ) . this stand-out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress franks , who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer . fourth and most amusing yarn , ""the cloak"" - pompous horror movie star paul henderson ( delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by jon pertwee ) purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it . this item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious ingrid pitt as enticing vampiress carla . director peter duffell , working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe robert bloch , maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere . kudos are also in order for ray parslow's crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by michael dress . highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare .",1,8

"why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how ? having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago , i can say that there is little if anything from the original book . i went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these . this is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name . this is not the story of carlito brigante , it is the story of a totally different character who is been given the same name . they have just totally spat in the face of every carlito's way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting luis guzman , who plays a crucial character in the original movie , in a different role . what's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original , untouched material of the book carlito's way - something i really would have liked to have seen . i felt the same way about chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of australia's most feared underworld figure , instead they made a ho-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook ( though eric bana's performance was spot-on ) . now we will never get to see carlito's real initial rise and fall . the three stars is because , looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick , it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances ( jay hernandez is no carlito but he could be good in other roles ) and the story is not too bad . even puffy combs suits his role . but they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time ( i am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff ) - something which the original film and the books got right ( having been written by then attorney and now judge edwin torres ) . the fact is though , it is not a stand alone - it is perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed .",0,3

"""margaritas and cock . . . "" this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs , surprises and unexpectedly touching moments . i had more fun watching ""the matador"" than almost any other film from 2005 . it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character , played to perfection by pierce brosnan . julian noble ( brosnan ) is a facilitator ( hit-man ) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs ( assassinating rich dudes ) . he is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis . after coming to realization that he has no real friends , no permanent home and no planned future , he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright ( kinnear ) . danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him . he loves his wife dearly , especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier . the two men are chalk and cheese , hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night . and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever . the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy . one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble . the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned , due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear . but make no mistake . . . this is brosnan's film . he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade . he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you would probably forgive him . brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer , but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date . i would not be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role . consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line , ""all blushy blushy . . . no sucky fucky"" . he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it . he manages to tell a young boy , ""tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years . then get back to me"" without coming across as unlikable . in fact , it makes us like him even more . and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes , most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns . however , when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday , or when danny and his wife ( davis ) console each other in their bedroom one night , the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion . ""the matador"" is stylish and energetic . it is constantly entertaining . and it contains a career-defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy , friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life . this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible . tc candler of independentcritics . com",1,9

"i cannot for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released . i do not remember who i went with , which theater i was in , or even which city . all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film , and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over . unfortunately i stuck it out to end , which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far . my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says ""look for problem child 2 , coming soon !

"french production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september 11 . the film segments vary widely in content and quality . two allude to u . s . complicity in terrorist acts ( in chile against allende , who died on september 11 , 1973 , depicted in the segment by british director ken loach; and in palestine by u . s . -backed israelis , shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine ) . two more recall other destructive acts ( a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv , shot by israeli director amos gitan; the japanese ""holy war"" against the west in ww ii , by shohei imamura ) . ironies abound in several stories . shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn's piece , bringing the man momentary joy . but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone . in mira nair's film , based on a real incident , a missing young man , also in new york city , the son of a pakistani family , is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist , but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers . there are poignant moments dotted throughout . loach has his exiled chilean man quote st . augustine , to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage : anger at the way things are , courage to change them . imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war . samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren , exiled in iran , trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york . but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp , where two men have fallen into a deep well , one killed , the other sustaining a broken leg . this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds . idrissa ouedraogo , from burkina faso , creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist , in order to get the $25 million u . s . reward . he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans , for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes , while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute . it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu ( maker of ""amores perros"" ) who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment , one that , for the most part , shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds . brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers , and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground . the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot , bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic , then with a translation added : ""does god's light guide us or blind us ?

"just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980 made-for-tv film attention . but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev . jim jones , who built a church into a virtual empire , and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated , and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking kool-aid doused with cyanide . done very tastefully but horrifying enough , unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned , guyana tragedy features an all-star cast , including ned beatty ( as rep . leo ryan ) , meg foster , randy quaid , brad dourif , brenda vaccaro , levar burton , and madge sinclair . but it is powers boothe ( in his first big role ) that really stands out as jim jones . he actually becomes the man , and his performance is riveting and chilling . thus , it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years .",1,9

"i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited . it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's . it recalled me also fugitive movies , a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland . however , the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time . as i see , many people say that this is like a tv movie . not exactly . firstly , there are much more better tv movies in this genre . secondly , tv movies might be very fun sometimes , but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time . it is not stylish at all visually and the most important , the tone of the movie is unappealing . this is not an action movie , there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash . also they are not big action scenes , but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie . the love affair between douglas and bassinger was very unnecessary . besides , the assassination plot to the president is the most clich story in this genre either , but they insist on that . and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be . although , douglas is very old now , he has still potential for acting in an action thriller . in the film , michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones , for example . sutherland is a wrong choice either , because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow , its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie , eva longoria parker is a strange choice , of course she is too passive or straight in this movie , because she is a soap opera actress . the movie was not fun even one second to me , so i could not get over for a while .",0,1
"generically speaking , fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in american movies , unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky parker posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious jeff goldblum . they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other , even radiating with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info-dumps . nevertheless , if one were to deconstruct fay grim , one would see many instances in which countless scenes could have been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being . this sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool , which was made ten years earlier . it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband , the predecessor's titular anti-hero . available within them is information that could concede the safety of the united states . fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clich s featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to following the girl to double-crosses to triple-crosses . the primary appeal of it all for me is that it is such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town . in the original henry fool , posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life . hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s , but i do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent nearne sister out of her , giving her a terrific predicament , as he did to her character's brother , played by james urbaniak , in henry fool , as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of goldblum . hartley , however , is simply riding on that fragmentary idea . his plot , though complex and labyrinthine , true to the form of the spy film , it seems as if to be entirely capricious . the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds , not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum . the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them . it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters , but with how they do not seem to hold their own alongside them , though saffron burrows certainly comes close . most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet , stringing us along with info-dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes . they are shot almost entirely in tiled angles , as if hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material . liam aiken , however , playing the now teenage son of fay and henry , has a certain allure about him , seeming wise beyond his years , certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters . perhaps hartley intended that , or maybe it is simply aiken's presence . the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there . as scorsese said , ""cinema is a matter of what is in the frame and what is out . "" one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film .",1,7
"this was a very thought provoking film , especially for 1973 . at the time it was actually a huge box office success . after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten , but its central messages were too important to disappear completely . it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time . . . no one had ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect'before 1985 , and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up . the sets and special effects might look a little outdated , but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period . if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense . this is a message movie , not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions . this was also hestons last good film , the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy . after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash . this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made , and the ending might be creepy and depressing , but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this .",1,7
"at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it . in all honesty , my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie . and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman , when a new version of that just came out . . . nice touch guys , it was misleading enough to rope me in . the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut . usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it . the film looks like it was shot by a d+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes . . . . sometimes , less is more buddy . through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained . all this makes a bad movie but when the ending does not even come close to pulling it together , well , that makes it an exceptionally bad movie . without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen , and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school , but hey maybe i am a bit biased , i mean i did get to play an extra . p . s . i do not even think this deserves a star . . . not even a half . none for you ! !",0,1

"it was once suggested by pauline kael , never a fan , that cassavetes thought not like a director , but like an actor . what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker; to take that comparison further , to me , it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film , it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation , like orson welles . cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles , but far more important as a true artist ( as opposed to a technician or rhetorician ) . this is like a cross between italian passion ( though cassavetes was actually greek ) and scandinavian introversion . never before have inner demons been so exposed physically . it's about the mystery of becoming , performing , and acting . like a haunted skip james record , it is got the echoes of ghosts all around . rowlands' breakdowns , which are stupefying and almost operatic , surprising coming from cassavetes , are accompanied by a jumpy , unsettling piano . who is this dead girl ? the metaphysical possibilities are endless , and it is amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film , just the overt display of intelligence ( there is also a brief bit of voice-over at the beginning ) . but then , he always was intelligent , he just never flapped it around for easy praise . this is not ""adaptation""; here , the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates . there's so much going on . the pure , joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman; the horror when she beats herself up . . . the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone . you can see some roots of this in ""a star is born , "" and almodovar borrowed from it for ""all about my mother . "" i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits , but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening . ( you can shoot me , but i think the alcoholism , despite its urgency in many of the scenes , is a relatively small point about the film . ) it's a living , breathing thing , and it feels like a process : it could go any direction at any time . like ""taste of cherry , "" we are reminded that ""you must never forget this is only a play . "" yet it is dangerous : when rowlands says that line , is it great drama ? how will the audience take it ? is she being reflexive or does she just not care ? her ( character's ) breakdowns are incorporated into the performances , and ultimately the film , in such a way that it is like witnessing a female james dean . 10/10",1,10

"this was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40's - warner bros . at the very height of their style . the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing . max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method . the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable . it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""now , voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite , ciefly because it starred bette davis . in my opinion , ""the gay sisters"" is a much better film - better made in all departments , and more interesting , complex and enjoyable . a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is , rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection . each thing has to be judged in it is own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms . most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point . if you are hungry for a perfect filet mignon , do not go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry . the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population . sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots , you would all be gleefully gratified . i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week !",1,10

"with few exceptions , most of george bernard shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days . too arch , too talky appears to be the general verdict . this bbc version of one of shaw's funniest plays does not refute that verdict . it is certainly arch and talky , but it is also wonderful . and because of the quality of british theater , it is perfectly cast with actors whom -- with the exception of helena bonham carter -- most of us have probably never heard of . carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional ""chocolate soldier"" ( pip torrens ) and later falls in love with him . one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius ( patrick ryecart ) , the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy's lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns . however , the role invites over-acting and ryecart was obviously told to over-act . the other players are letter perfect . carter as the self-dramatizing bulgarian ""aristocrat"" and torrens as the swiss soldier-of-fortune are at the play's center , of course , and they are wonderful . yes , ""arms and the man"" comes across as a filmed play . but you are unlikely ever to see a shaw film that does not betray its origin . the plots are generally clever . however , shaw is all about the dialog . the action is minimal ( even in st . joan ) and the sets are immaterial . enjoy this for what it is .",1,8
"i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent , style , and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he is become known for in the past decade . as much as the film is g-rated , it is pure lynch in style , pacing , and tone . the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power . the cinematography is terrific , as is to be expected from a lynch film , and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking . it's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly , kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either ""good"" or ""evil"" . richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher , and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role . with this film , david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'blue velvet' and 'the elephant man' . critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'twin peaks : fire walk with me' and 'lost highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh , and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive' , considering the high praise it is received and the oscar nomination for lynch .

"nahhh ! leila ( grace mills ) is a teenager turned on to satan ( and lsd ) by her archaeologist fianc richard . there's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle , where leila and richard drink blood , drop drugs , join in sex orgies , dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants , masks and capes and the women do not wear anything at all . unfortunately , these kind of extracurricular activities have left leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded ""spirit of evil . "" leila also comes from a screwed up family , which does not help either . her older brother john is a recluse who seems to be in love with her . her mother patricia ( maria perschy ) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death . to top it off , her sister ( maria kosti ) is a slutty semi pro golfer named ( gasp ! ) debbie gibson . there's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time . two maids ( a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone ) , plus udo ( luis induni ) , a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on leila changing clothes , takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit . oh yeah and borg , the pet german shepherd . paul naschy is father adrian dunning , the doubting priest ( zzzzz ) who starts snooping around after john and richard both have their heads twisted around backwards . leila tells him ""they say i am perverse and i'm going to prove it is true ! "" during her birthday party , she tells her guests ""you make me sick ! i hate you all ! "" and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches ""i do not want to see that fat ass ! "" debbie suggests they commit leila to a ""sanitory , "" but leila runs off and joins the cult again . she is rescued ( again ) and brought back home ( for the third time ) . by this point in the movie , there is only about ten minutes left to go and all we have basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how leila is acting weird . it's almost as agonizing to sit through as an andy milligan movie , minus the gore and laughs . but finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an exorcist-like possession flick . unfortunately , the best part of it are the contact lenses leila gets to wear . some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms , legs and face , she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles . she begins reeking of rotted flesh , spits up some clear gunk , starts speaking in her dead dad's voice , sneaks into her mom's bedroom , slaps her around a bit and calls her a ""filthy bitch of a whore . "" in comes father adrian , who now finally believes she is indeed possessed , fends off her attempts at seduction , hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses leila with holy water . doors open and close , a mirror breaks , there is sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor . after she tackles dunning and the two roll down the stairs , the spirit is out of her and into - guess who ? why , borg the family pooch ! the demon dog then turns on adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker . then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film . it's leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self . but then there is another time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body . it's so badly done , you really have no clue what to make of it , which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they have wasted an hour and a half on this worthless pos . screw the contacts , 1 out of 10 it is .",0,1

"well where to start here ? straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma . had this film come out of italy in , say , 1975 , been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess , then i'd be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summer's day . because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema , dan reed has produced a rape/revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england , and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowan's leg into a machine gun . because if you want to play grindhouse bingo , then let me call out the 'numbers' : 1 . rich , high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and , equally implausibly , gets the hots for him . check . 2 . gratuitous shots of said high-flying career woman in various states of nudity . check . 3 . convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in . check . 4 . unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape . check . 5 . gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off . bingo ! plotwise , straightheads is pretty basic stuff : dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss . on the way home , they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson . the couple then set about getting their revenge . so far , so ""straw dogs"" , ""late night trains"" , ""house on the edge of the park"" , ""i spit on your grave"" etc etc . so why did not i think much of this film ? a number of reasons : i suppose first off , having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better , but it is the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most . because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70's , then they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator . the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies , the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back , and everyone goes home satisfied , their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored . as writer and director however , dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that , and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there . for instance , when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers , they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with . when anderson finally meets him face to face , he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter ! ! ! the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw-dropping , it is almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience's moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they have just sat through something of significance . to make sure we 'get it' , at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time , ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter , but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough-handled and raped across the bonnet of her car . gratuitous does not enter into it . after being told his reasons for raping her , anderson ties him over a table , rams the business end of a sniper rifle ( complete with bulky silencer , just in case anyone was not clear on the phallic imagery ) up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger , telling dyer ( who has no such moral qualms ) that 'it is over' . dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes . it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness . in fairness , ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film . it's obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and , bless her , she certainly does that; one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun ? dyer , on the other hand , does what he is done in virtually every film he is made to date - that is , plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin , a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching . this is particularly true at the closing scene where , after murdering his assailants in cold blood , dyer gazes at the camera in , what i'm sure is meant to be , a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome , but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess . which incidentally , sums up this film quite nicely .",0,3

"hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters . this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . here's a tip : any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading ""in the future . . . "" is going to be fun . this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you . in this case , ""in the future . . . "" means that , instead of fighting wars , nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine , well , that is never terribly clear , but it is probably something really important . there are good guys ( obviously capitalists , i . e . ""us"" ) and bad guys ( commies ! ) and there are big stop-motion robots . sadly , the effects budget was pretty slim , so we do not get to see a lot of the big robots . there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes , and then a big space fight near the end . the space fight is especially nice , as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget . with said money now spent , the climactic fight degenerates into ( and i'm not making this up ) two guys hitting each other with sticks . i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene , complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads . like i said-it is dumb . that's why i bought the tape .",1,8
"many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow . although the story-line was rather typical of clara's later silents , i still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun . clara plays a happy-go-lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves . . . never mind that this man is married ! clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day , but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie . though definitely not a brilliant story-line ( quite typical , actually ) , this movie is a nice showcase of clara's ability to make the audience laugh .",1,9
"the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the archers' logo , the introductory disclaimer , the way the camera pans over the cosmos . it's strange to think that `it's a wonderful life' came out in the same year . no great coincidence : the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered , something best passed over in silence , when placed next to alfred junge's vision . it continues to look great all the way through , as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us . i'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general . one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other . not so here . powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it is the most natural thing in the world , a mere change of palettes . both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own . as for the story . . . this may be pressburger's best script , or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events . other than that it is tight , yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here . was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary ? ( or both ? perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was , as it so happened , true . ) everyone says we are meant to neither ask nor answer this question , but i do not see why . i'm sure we are meant to ask the question . the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed , the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions . the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well does not mean that this should not occupy us as well . there is , as i've said before , a lot going on . consider the scene in which abraham farlan ( heaven's prosecuting lawyer ) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match , and contemptuously says , `the voice of england , 1945 . ' dr . reeves ( the defence ) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment , and then produces one of his own : a blues song from america , which farlan listens to as though he is got a lemon in his mouth . reeves looks smug . snobbery ? well , i do not see why it is snobbish to condemn blues music - and that is not what powell and pressburger are doing , anyway . as the song is being played , we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it : several of them nod their heads to the rhythm , perfectly at home . they do not find it incomprehensible . there's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is . reeves probably realises as much . all english audiences ( and all australian , indian , etc . audiences as well ) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast , too; and that while reeves understands that , he is unable to explain it to farlan - hence the blues broadcast , which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else . it's a clever scene . one last thing . i found david niven a bit cold , without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so , i do not think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began , as this one did .",1,10

"in reviewing this film i can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in july , august , and september of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth , fort polk , louisiana . take the high ground was not anything like i remember basic training . but one has to remember at the time this was post korea which ended in a stalemate , but it was a conventional war as we knew them . it was not vietnam , a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit . the draft at that time was an unwelcome , but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense . richard widmark is a veteran of korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas . the film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train . they're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade . one thing i will praise take the high ground for is the fact that mgm recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of william hazard as a black recruit in the platoon . it was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing . but i will say that a recruit like russ tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one . richard widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give jerome courtland confidence with a weapon . and no way would have he worried so much about robert arthur deserting . he's have just let the mps deal with him . of course being shot in and around fort bliss and el paso , texas did give take the high ground good authenticity . but view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day . i do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were not worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95% of the time . but there am not no way that karl malden would have slugged widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits . both would have realized that would have undermined authority , something the military just does not let happen . i wish i could have said something better about take the high ground because i certainly like its talented cast , it is talented director richard brooks , even the silly theme by dimitri tiomkin and ned washington , fresh from their oscar a year before for high noon . the film actually got an oscar nomination for best screenplay and story by millard kaufman . it must have been for kaufman's vivid imagination .",0,3

"this production never really got off the ground for me . the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you have read the novel or seen a better adaptation ( like the 1995 one with amanda root ) you are going to be a bit lost since there is no time for character development . i liked sally hawkins as anne , but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been . mrs . croft was far too old , as was anne's elder sister elizabeth . mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost . much better was sophie thompson's mary , whose selfishness and sense of ill-usage is so well established that by the time wentworth suggests anne stay with the injured louisa and mary objects that she , as louisa's sister in law , should stay instead , you cannot imagine anyone less suited to do so . in this version , she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production . rupert penry-jones is nice to look at , but he made a much better st . john rivers ( 1995 jane eyre ) , probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling . i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene : seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor . likewise the accident scene : it happens so fast and with so little context , you wonder what all the fuss is about . and moving the speech that wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script . my other problem with this version was the lighting . sometimes everything looked like a scene from the csi morgue -- very very blue . other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well , like when anne visits her old school friend , mrs . smith ( who , by the way , is supposed to be more or less paralyzed . having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr . elliot's awful character was such a violation that for a minute i could not think who she was -- i thought she was one of the musgrove girls . and she might as well have been . all the girls were pretty much interchangeable ) . and the running scene at the end . . . in an era where propriety was at a premium , it is hard to imagine gentle anne tearing all over bath like some demented hoyden . how silly can you get ? it's too bad . sally hawkins had all the makings of a good anne elliot , but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over-truncated production .",0,4

"i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention . zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with schnaas' other horrible zombie entry - zombie doom ( aka violent sh ! t 3 ) . these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot . i somehow managed ( barely . . . ) to sit through zombie doom - but zombie 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to schnaas' other horrible film - that i had to fast-forward through everything after the first 10 minutes . zero acting skills , inept gore , horrible camcorder-style camera-work , ridiculous dubbing . . . it just goes on and on . i really cannot find a single thing redeeming about this garbage - and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film . this truly is one of the worst films ever made - you've been warned . . . 1/10",0,1
"nicolas roeg ? he directed the classic supernatural thriller don`t look now didn`t he ? strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever . you see it`s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don`t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak . this doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it`s impossible not to notice them . if i didn`t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all . one can`t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen cheap production values , disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie",0,4
"watching the commercials for this movie , i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it . for one thing , it was one of those ""loosely based on the novel"" movies , which usually means that the book author saw the script , hated it , and refused to be associated with the film . worse , the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ( ex : kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose . . . and falls over ) . so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the ""must see"" film of the season ( of course , he thought the same thing about ""cars"" , ""over the hedge"" , ""the ant bully"" , ""monster house"" , etc , etc ) , i was admittedly less than thrilled . but once at the theater , the film won me over for a variety of reasons . first and foremost , the writers capture 'kid dialogue' better than just about any other children's film i've ever seen . a prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet . the boys do a lame , over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them , which makes it realistic since all little kids think ( mistakenly ) that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors . then one of the boys asks , ""why did he say , 'alley oop' ? "" another boy responds , ""maybe he is crazy ! "" and the entire group laughs uproariously . not an overly witty rejoinder , but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious . as if to confirm it , my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen; i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation . another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying , sibling relationships , the new kid in school , and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special . for example , the bully ( joe ) is not stereotypical; he is definitely bad but not pure evil , and just enough of his home-life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins . there's also no ""cue the dramatic music"" moment where billy ( 'worm boy' ) realizes what a complete tool he is being to his younger brother woody , and yet , by the end of the movie , some type of minor transformation has been made . there's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other , and very little of it comes across as corny . the only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonald's dance party in ""mac and me"" would scoff at . why oh why was it put into the movie ? ? did austin rogers ( adam ) pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills ? the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on ""the history channel"" . overall , though , this movie was excellent , and the length ( about an hour and twenty minutes ) was just about perfect . one of the best , most realistic live action kid films you will ever see if you are ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like .",1,10

"bottom of the barrel , unimaginative , and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior . this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far ! bad acting , dialog , effects , dubbing , pacing , action sequences . . . the list goes on and on . italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in the early 80's , some good , some bad . this is the worst by far , no contest . not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable , the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half . there was 1 ( one ) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie , and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding . but everything else about this movie seriously reeks ! for actual post-nuke fun , go track down a copy of endgame , after the fall of new york , or escape from the bronx instead . they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish .",0,2
"don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one , this is a gem ! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living ! she , naturally , becomes a reporter , and he , just as naturally , a driver for the mob ! by wild co-incidences their careers meet head on , thanks to gangster clark gable . in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers ( with all the grace of a steam-shovel ) . but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it is all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days , when hollywood was really naughty . joan looks great , and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity ( thank god she stopped the dancing ! ) . gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not a star yet and so did not have to be the hero . great to see him playing something different . and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother . and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont , who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience ! great fun !",1,10

"a young woman who is a successful model , and is also engaged to be married , and who has twice attempted suicide in the past , is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next ""sentinel"" to the gateway to hell , which apparently goes through a creepy old , but well maintained brooklyn apartment building . its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves , but apparently cannot escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way . the previous one ( john carradine ) is about dead , so she , by fate or whatever , becomes the next one , and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free . lots of interesting details lie under the surface , her relationship with her father , the stories of the doomed , her fianc , so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror , but given the sets , the great cast , and overall level of bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing .",1,8
"never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent . let's see : first , they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread . next , they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget . and finally , when the film hits the theaters , get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again , bus them into the multiplexes if necessary , not on the merits of the film itself , but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory . but that , of course , will not be enough . i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give ""left behind"" anything short of a glowing review will be deemed ""anti-christian . "" of course , this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign should not surprise anyone . it is , after all , good old fashioned capitalism at work . what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole ""left behind"" mindset . as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality , it leaves me scratching my head . it would appear that there are many , many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a ""rapture"" is going to occur , and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air . what kind of reality , i wonder , are these people living in ? is this ""rapture"" something they actually believe in , or is it something they fervently want to believe in ? and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this ""rapture"" has not occurred , will they be disappointed and disillusioned ? will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the ""rapture"" is imminent ? in a way , i almost wish that such an event would occur ! what an interesting day that would be ! what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion , not in the anthropological sense the authors of the ""left behind"" series have portrayed , but as more of a stephen spielberg production , with boiling clouds , trumpets , angels descending out of the sky , moon turned to blood , the whole nine yards . imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true , just as the evangelists had been warning for years , and that there was something more awesome than just the cold , hard , physical reality we inhabit . wouldn't that be something ? ? ? yet in the final analysis , it is that cold , hard , physical reality that i will content myself with . my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a ""rapture"" and the ""end times"" to make sense of it all . . . nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently , thank you very much .",0,1

"i sought this film out because i'm a new frain fan and wanted to see more of his work . first of all , his irish accent is great . he's got a keen ear for dialects , it seems . his acting was marvelous , as usual . james frain aside , i thought the film was very well done . it showed the conflict in northern ireland as the *mess* it really is . both sides are guilty of grave injustices , and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances . also , it is interesting to realise that not every man ( or woman ) that is supposedly fighting for his country , is really doing *just* that . for example , when kenny ( james frain ) asks ginger ( ian hart ) why he does ""it"" , ginger cannot come up with a morally acceptable answer . why ? because ginger is not in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow protestants . . . ginger is in it for the fun of killing . he's full of blood-lust and it is the perfect job for a guy like him . in a struggle like this there are guys like liam ( john lynch ) who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families . . . guys that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting . there are guys like kenny that are born leaders full of charisma , and they add fuel to the flames , rather they mean to or not . also , kenny genuinely believes in the ""cause"" . he believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future . . . which is a bit odd because his character seems too intelligent for it all . but , like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men , he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it . . . 'til it is too late . then there is ginger , a pure psycho who is not in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it , which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset , some might argue . however , now , in this film , ginger has out lasted his worth , and has become a very dangerous loose cannon . everything comes to a boiling point , and predictably , the ending is a tragic one . what makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict . being american , i cannot begin to fully understand what all struggle is about . but , i do know there has to be a better way . all in all , a well acted , touching . . . but troubling film .",1,9
"i did not really go into ""reign over me"" knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story . the plot was easy enough to understand , i suppose . this guy's whole family died in 9/11 , and he shuts the world out of his life . alright . i did not know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it , and it really does not on a very obvious level , so if you are scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours , i would not worry about it . i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention ""september the eleventh"" . overall , i was impressed . it was a very moving picture . the movie has a sense of humor , and it is very sharp , but it is definitely a drama where it counts . i typically do not like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting , but sometimes , let us be honest , they are . adam sandler is definitely capable of it ( and though i think so , you may disagree , jim carrey is also very well-rounded . . sometimes ) . sandler's portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable . i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnson's ( don cheadle in another excellent role , if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures ) wife , who is played well by jada pinkett smith , calling her static and dull , but that is completely untrue . she has depth , but some of it gets hidden behind the main story , which does drift in and out of focus occasionally . ( which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie , with a weird ""make everything out of focus"" fadeout . after about the first 40 minutes , they are not used anymore . maybe it is significant for the characters outlook , artistically , or maybe they just realized how irritating it was . ) the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point ( one of several , but definitely the most explicit ) of the story , which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way . maybe it seems unorthodox to us , maybe it seems downright unhealthy , but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget . to just exist . the films soundtrack was excellent , and it used music to pursue and amplify moods , rather than establish them , which gives credit to the actors and the writers . the movie takes it is name from the song ""love , reign o'er me"" , off of the who's rock opera , quadrophenia . the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story , but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax , and at the very end . the movie is paced well , and does not feel like it is dragging anywhere in it is length , which is a little over 2 hours . if you can accept adam sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man , you will enjoy the movie . you will become entangled in the story , and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it . it is not the best movie of the year , and there is nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it , but it is a very enjoyable , watchable movie , all in all .",1,8

"my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh , creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate , you never knew what lay on the other side ! starting around season 5 , the show took a different focus - still good , but different . the series follows the adventures of a team of humans ( and one alien ) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the ""stargate"" . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie ""stargate"" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt . the episodes are light ( innocent and easy to watch ) and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable . the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious , but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch . starting somewhere around season 5 , the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe ( the goa'uld , then the ori ) . the plots become more complex ( a lot more political/strategic oriented ) and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature . one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes . they are simply cannot-miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons . if you are a sci-fi fan , watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you will likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides , you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to .",1,8

"george cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch . ronald colman's performance , which earned him an oscar , still stands up despite a few overwrought moments it is hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life . there are a number of interesting subtexts and cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much . the script by garson kanin and ruth gordon is brilliant , mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from shakespeare's ""king lear"" as a reference to both the film's main theme of jealousy and colman's character's obsession with identity . several interesting things about this movie superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors . in other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets . but i do not really think this story's primary concern is acting or the job/art of acting per se . i think anthony's struggles represents a broader existential question , a deeply buried uncertainty about identity . there's a key , i feel , in his relationship with his ex-wife britta ( signe hasso ) . he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration . and at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her . i'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me , especially because it is his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top . perhaps the implication is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship . marriage implies a ""union of the soul"" in the traditional conception . it's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film . it's not completely unprecedented ( hawks' comedy ""his girl friday"" springs to mind , among others ) , but it is unusual and probably significant , especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation . in a way , the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self-love .",1,8
"""kalifornia"" is one of my all-time favourite movies , and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s . the film has a very stylish surface to it , but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others . one of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances , brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named early . pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly . juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend , her innocence is almost heart-breaking . ""kalifornia"" has a very simple plot to it , that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour , but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder , as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality . there are alot of shocking scenes , and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days . ""kalifonia"" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be , and not only for it`s violence and gore .",1,9

"kubrick meets king . it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 , i remember . then the movie came out , and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since . the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it . the kubrick cultists do not give a damn about king's story . they talk about steadicams , tracking shots , camera angles . this is a film , they insist : it should be considered on its own . as it happens , both camps are correct . unfortunately . if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel , ""the shining"" is indeed a failure , a wasted opportunity , a series of botched narrative gambits . i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter . the writer diane johnson ( author of le marriage , l'affaire , le divorce , etc . ) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners . maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics . but the little blue-collar town of sidewinder , colorado does not exist on any map in her francophile universe . kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial , however . he , of course , is the real auteur . and considered on its own merits , his screenplay for ""the shining"" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology , rationalism , supernaturalism , and implied reincarnation -- just does not stand up to logical analysis . i'm willing to consider kubrick's ""shining"" on its own terms . i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie . but it does not succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation , alienation , and madness either . parsed either way , the film pretty much falls apart . are the horrors of the overlook hotel real ? or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance , then as the hallucinations of his father ? one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ""ghost"" he is in fact looking into a mirror . one notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize jack's stunted , convoluted psyche . very deep stuff . but if indeed the overlook's ""ghosts"" are purely manifestations of jack torrance's growing insanity , then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet , so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage ? and can anyone explain , with a straight face , that black-and-white photograph ( helpfully labelled ""1921"" ) of nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds ? are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance's bad craziness stems from a some sort of ""past life"" experience ? ( and if you swallow that , since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves ? ) maybe kubrick did not care about his storyline . maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror . whatever the case , the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways , rational and supernatural . as a result , the story is a mess . this movie has not improved with age , and it certainly does not improve with repeated viewings . i do not deny that a few moments of fear , claustrophobia , and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long , long film . but those gushing elevators o' blood , seen repeatedly in little danny's visions , are absurd and laughable . and jack torrance's infamous tag lines ( ""wendy , i'm home ! "" and ""heeeeeere's johnny ! "" ) merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy . ( i know : i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief : ""whew ! glad we do not have to take this stuff seriously ! "" ) finally , kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son . a foyer full of mummified guests , all sitting there dead in their party hats ? yikes , now i really am afraid . given jack nicholson's brilliance over the years , one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling , eyebrow-wiggling , scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted . the performance of shelley duvall , as a sort of female version of don knotts in ""the ghost and mr . chicken , "" is best passed over in silence . this movie simply does not succeed -- not as an adaptation , not on its own terms . it probably merits a 3 out of 10 , but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over-rated in this forum .",0,1
"an excellent series , masterfully acted and directed , but unloved ( i am told ) by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation . it is now only viewable in private collections , and via the british film institute at special request . very unfortunate , as ian holm's nuanced portrayal of the weary-but-determined bernard samson is superb; one of his very best performances . the supporting cast , including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser , are superb . with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife , and michael degen as the mercurial werner , the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game .",1,10
"this movie is goofy as hell ! i think it was written as a serious film , but then when it came time to film , michael cooney said ""hey , let us throw in some humor and spice it up !

"well , the movie is not exactly ""funny . "" okay , i admit , there are a few humorous lines , but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny . for example : right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars , sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt . before leaving the room to retrieve the key , he tells her , ""okay , do not go anywhere . "" see , humorous , but not funny . the plot and acting are pretty good . but erika eleniak definitely steals the show . she is hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one cannot help but rewind and re-watch . there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines . overall , 5 stars . i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak .",1,10
"i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons . for the first half hour it is actually pretty decent . although the acting is not any better then that which you would find in a rap video , its kinda funny and the production value does not seem half bad . in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao ( another recent dominican film ) which turned out to be much much better than i expected . the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole , which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic . unfortunately i do not think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter , and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them . about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits . not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge , space age , cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's , but the whole plot just goes down the drain . the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations , and clever one liners . to top it all off ( and i guess i should warn you now **spoiler alert** ) it all turns out to be a dream . oh my who did not see that coming ? oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie . well after about an hour into it i start thinking "" hmmmm something just does not seem right about the sound track but what can it be ? ? "" and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95 . when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art ? ! ? ! perhaps a comedy to match france's amelie , or an action flick to match thailand's ong-bak , an animation as akira was to japan , a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england , or a socio-awakening journey as waking life had here in the states . . . . i would give it a 1 but i have seen much worse come out of dr , search los jodedores and you will know what i'm talking about .",0,2
"**possible spoilers** the biggest part of the movie that does not work is the wendigo , and when your title character fails , your movie usually is not far behind it . the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting , and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror , for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good . however , as a monster character it never really comes to life . we do not get much of an explanation for its behavior , and what we do see from it does not jibe with either the story told in the movie itself , or any wendigo lore i've ever read . i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is not given enough to do , in the movie . when you boil this film down to its bones , what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element , instead of a movie about a monster . the cinematography is good , though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery , lighting , and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well . the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable , making him the real monster in the film . it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo , which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend . i have heard unconfirmed reports ( from a newsgroup ) that the reason the wendigo does not do much is that , when the monster suit was built , it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves , the performer had to walk on his toes ) that it was nearly impossible to run , walk , or otherwise perform in it . thus the many flashes of the creature standing still , and the obvious sped-up footage of it running . i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed .",1,7
"this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens' bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book . contrary to what is probably received opinion , diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock . she was clunky and wooden . lady d . is a reserved character but not a martinet . denholm elliot is wrong , wrong , wrong for mr . jarndyce . so i'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying : ""i did not read the book , so i do not have to take this guy's opinion because he is basing his evaluations on the book . "" true and not true . for ex , diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you have read the book . on the other hand , denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce ( although too old ) . the series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book , but because the various plot lines and characters just do not coalesce to make a coherent , dramatic , mysterious andcompelling entertainment . it is dull and flat . if you want to make apossibly good bleak house , you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes . but i suggest that producers etc . leave dickens alone ( even a christmas carol ) . television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters .",0,2
"the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what greene wrote; for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre , or the murdered-child obsession that takes over some of the plot . where the film deviates from the novel , it tends to the ludicrous . however i do not want to suggest that the film is bad in any way . it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un . some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anything . it's a dreadful shame that the film's not available on dvd .",1,8

"if you are already a fan of peter o'donnell's wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties , you will really enjoy this movie . if you have ever seen the 1966 ""modesty blaise"" film , forget it ! that was camp . this is the real modesty blaise . the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love . it's a long way from joe losey's 1966 travesty , and it takes our modesty quite seriously . alexandra staden is quite good and believable in the part , and yes , we do get to see her kick butt . chuckle this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty , her childhood and her days with lob . since peter o'donnell was the creative consultant on the movie , everything really rings true . even the story o'donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it . having read all the books , i enjoyed the movie even more for that . now that miramax has kept their option on the property by having quentin tarrentino make this film , i do hope to see more of the modesty stories asap . especially as the wonderful character of willie garvin makes modesty's character really come alive . to that end , i really hope the film does well in europe . i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa . i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution . i wonder how miramax decides where and how to distribute it is films . in the story , modesty is in her early 20's , working at louche is casino in tangier . the flashback sequences are artfully done and take modesty from about 9 years old , through her teens up to her current age in the movie - about 21-22 , i'd guess . i really do not think there is a ""perfect actress"" for modesty . for many of us modesty fans , she is much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already . alexandra staden is credible . she is very slim , graceful and poised . she has lots of closeups . she has a great face - one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over . according to o' donnell's illustrator , romero , modesty has rather a fuller figure than staden , but i'm willing to overlook that . if staden continues in the role , i think she will mature into it - just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older . staden already conveys modesty's humor and absolute assurance very well . go ahead and rent this movie , it is not like anything else you have seen and even though it was directed by scott spiegel , it is full of tarrentino touches , great camera moves , lighting and well-done action sequences .",1,8

"seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers . perhaps it is because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth , or are we missing something ? i'd watch it again if i had some incentive . so what is a happenstance ? to the french it is ""le battement d'ailes du papillon"" serendipity ? fate ? perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings . we've all had these ( it is called life ) but when looked at in this way , you begin to get the feeling that ""random"" might be more like ""fated . "" a 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble . all these incidents cause other events that . . . well you get the picture ? dominoes . multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen . and i think that there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this . but then this is the magic world of cinema . we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens . if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape , here's the place to do it . or if you are recovering from surgery and are not going anywhere anyway , this will engage you while your stitches are healing . ""happenstance"" will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following . stranger things have happened . soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following : ""life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward . "" if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences ( meeting your first love , finding the perfect gift , your last auto accident ) you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it . that's the answer ! i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain ""happenstance"" to me .",1,7

"the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases which is about two , three per year immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism . you're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype . you know , like it is popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not . let me just assure you that this is not the case . uwe boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry . ""seed"" is another most unfortunate of proof that . in here , boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist , like a plot , a narrative structure , character development , tension building ""seed"" is a hideous movie , full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage . i once read that ""seed"" was uwe boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks , but that is not even close . the film inarguably does borrow some influences from ""saw"" and ""hostel"" , but basically it is just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence . the first 45 minutes of ""seed"" are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen . for you see , boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a ( hyper- fast ) scrolling text explaining there is a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail . so you know this will happen later on , but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair . seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims ( exaggerate much ? ) who wears a bag over his head . he watches real-life animal cruelty footage ( and thus we watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that mr . boll ) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar ( including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted ) . when he is finally captured , during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed , and put on death row , the film even becomes more retarded . after being buried alive because the electric chair could not fry him , max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him . the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they are downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic . multiple twists and sub plot in ""seed"" are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they are just too dumb ! nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first . nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him ! ""seed"" is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes . personally , i refuse to accept that the cast & crew members did not notice this as well . it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism , and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to . i imagine his yelling stuff like ""shut up and do as you are told"" to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they are shooting does not make a lick of sense . just for the fun of upsetting people , there is a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she is tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room . instead of shocking , as boll intended it to be , this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is . ""seed"" is horrendous , it is disgusting , it is pitiable , it is boll .",0,1

"batman : mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie to be released . ( minor spoilers ahead ) the plot revolves around a new crimefighter , the batwoman , who seems to be personally involved , for whatever reason , in stopping a major arms shipment . although the movie is interesting enough , it is not as good as 'mask of the phantasm , ' 'sub-zero , ' or 'return of the joker . ' the main reason being is that it does not give off the emotional appeal the other movies did . at the end of this movie , we do not really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others , especially , 'sub-zero . ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us . even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character ( as mr . freeze or phantasm were ) . not only that , but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer does not really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we do not get this special emotional appeal . don't get me wrong , i did find the movie enjoyable . it does have its moments , such as , when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman : the animated series . ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments . if the batwoman's background was more interesting , this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book , but as it is now , it is in 4th ( out of 4 ) . as for the animation , it is the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's . the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films , but it is still good nonetheless . i do recommend buying this dvd because , despite its flaws , it is enjoyable . but just remember , it is not as good as the other batman animated movies . 7/10",1,7
"man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now , but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant ( which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked ) and charles laughton's intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead . despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones , it is a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to possibly be almost as bad as the men he dispatches . certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him does not inspire much confidence in his stability . as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull , it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score , which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus .",1,8
"full of spoilers . this is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on ira levin's play about two gay playwrights ( caine and reeve ) that plot the murder of one's rich wife ( cannon ) to get the property and the insurance . the plot succeeds but christopher reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details . reeve allows that easthampton , long island , can become southampton , long island , in the script , for instance . the rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth reeve does not mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into cannon's apparently accidental death . it will boost the revenues and his own warhol quotient . michael caine is sidney bruhl , the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play , perhaps with reeve's input , that would redeem his reputation . he cannot permit reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced . so -- what else ? -- he tries to murder him . in the end they wind up killing one another , the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor , the psychic helga tensdoorp , and she makes a million bucks selling it to broadway . it's a lot of fun for a number of reasons . one is the production design . that multi-roomed , multi-storied house with the big windmill atop , situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth ( easthampton ! ) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere . you would not be able to afford a pup tent in easthamptom . the house is not overly large or baroque in its decor . it's just magnificently modest , although it is a little tidy for my tastes , the kind of house that is so clean you are afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot . next , the acting could hardly be improved upon . caine , cannon , and fred jones are superb . dyan cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they would been sprayed on , which is okay given her assets . even reeve , whose talent was limited , seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer . irene worth , as the psychic neighbor helga , was in some way hard to define , a mistake . granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot , but , my god , what an offensive snoop her character is , going around and claiming , ""i feel pain in zis woom ! "" i suppose in order to make her a little more interesting , she is got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it . still , she is a nuisance from beginning to end . you have to love ira levin's bitchy dialog . the distraught caine begs reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play . ""because it is there , sidney ! "" says reeve , and caine shouts , ""that's mountains , not plays ! plays are not there until some ***hole writes them ! "" great too is caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright , as planned . he works himself up into a torrent of sobs , barely able to speak , as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately . when he hangs up , his face assumes its usual placid expression , he blows his nose into his handkerchief , and walks away , all business again . the climax , though suitably ironic , is confusing and noisy and full of artifice , lacking in the wicked charm that levin and lumet brought to the earlier scenes . the score is mostly made up of light-hearted riffs on the harpsichord , neatly fitting into the film . you'll probably enjoy it .",1,7

"never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example : norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox , ( wilhelm gimm ) ""gorky park"" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt , ( marja pacierkowski ) , ""chloe's prayer"" , played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film , and like this subject matter , give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly .",1,8
"christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film's end . this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs . the devil , to the gateway to hell , to bizarre rituals , to a growing conspiracy , and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film . we get ava gardner , burgess meredith , chris sarandon , jerry orbach , deborah raffin , arthur kennedy , jose ferrer , slyvia miles , beverly deangelo , eli wallach , martin balsam , christopher walkin , william hickey , tom berenger , jeff goldblum , and who can forget john carradine as the old priest . many of these actors ham it up - particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic/demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat . meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon . some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo . the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes . the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling . i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film , particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles . was that really necessary ? i think not . also , the father/daughter stuff was a bit much as well , but overall the film works and has a winning pace . director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments . the scenes with carradine are particularly effective .",1,7
"i saw this film when it was first released . the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years . i did not want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it , so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed , the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent , indecipherable , and uninspiring . a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron's husband , thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film . the film's roster of many capable actors - caron , warren oates , scatman crothers , gloria grahame , and james sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise . but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay . the ""mystery"" implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene . the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller , but never settles upon one or the other . the sense of suspense is entirely absent . the main characters settle on playing dry , emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever . the cinematography is pedestrian . the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters , the plot , and , in the end , the film itself . i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase . i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4 : 00 am slot .",0,1
"de grot is a very good film . the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb , who also adapted this story for the screen . some really top-class acting , not only by van hu t , but especially by marcel hensema , who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf . the film seems to kick of as a thriller , and sets an excellent mood . then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf , and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure , which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie . in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending , that will grab audiences by their throats . make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . a must-see , especially if you liked 'spoorloos' ( the vanishing's original screen adaptation ) .",1,9
"just saw ice age , a very funny and especially nice looking film . the story is simple but effective , the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design . more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality , the designs give you a really , really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour . sometimes the touches of reality shine through ( especially the water was impressive ) , but nonetheless , it is a fantasy-world based on reality . including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering . pixar films shine with technical brilliance , this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how . enough technical babble , the film's entertaining , family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny .",1,7
"bad actors , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all . after seeing films like this , you wonder why the makers bothered at all . this film has absolutely nothing to say , all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films . a total waste of time .",0,1
"it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about . the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate . the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this : a plot to kill the president of the united states . michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed . kiefer sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine . one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president , it also concerns a mole ( traitor ) in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction .",1,7
"while the title ""before the devil knows you're dead"" comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy . it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they have gotten themselves into . the cast is well-assembled with philip seymour hoffman & ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers . notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other . beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable . the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve . the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts . that being said , the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy , through and through . all in all , a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter kelly masterson . sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he is still directing at over eighty years old . i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it is not a major distraction . in the end , the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience .",1,7
"this film makes ""american pie"" a sophisticated movie ! no further comment needed . humor is cheap , dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward . every clich is used several times without any original twist . and far the worst , the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope . it's so sad .",0,1

"if you did not enjoy this movie , either your dead , or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle . an excellent cast , all of who gave good performances . this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor , despite what critics say . adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor . it all started with his performance in big daddy , then he did a couple bad movies , then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates , the longest yard , then click , and now reign over me . back to the movie . adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything . the closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law . after his old college roommate ( cheadle ) ran into him , he seems to turn his life around . i will say no more , because i do not want to ruin the movie , but i strongly recommend this movie . one of the best movies of 2007 .",1,10

"geez , another lifetime movie , but once again is not exactly the worst movie in the world , but far from the best . i think the main problem is that it is pretty obvious who is responsible for what , and it is generally fairly predictable . worse yet , some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing , and the viewer is left wondering ""okay , how much am i supposed to care ? "" one thing i did like is that the movie goes to show you that it is never that simple as ""the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad"" , and sometimes it is evil vs evil rather than good vs evil . hadley did not do what she did out of a sense of justice , she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family , and to eliminate the competition . as for alicia , it simply proves that a victim is not always a good person . some of them really do ""have it coming"" , even if ""it"" was a painful , horrible death . ""the burning bed"" is a great example of this , but the difference is that the vile man in ""the burning bed"" got exactly what he deserved . but , did alicia ""have it coming"" ? some will say that she did , but others do not agree , and the law generally does not either . as for acting , it is a mixed bag . some do a good job , like mia , but others just came across as indifferent to their roles . they were mostly wooden or simply not convincing . the music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy , especially if you like girl/girl action . the movie is not badly shot at all , but given its glaring weaknesses , the strengths are in background , unfortunately . i've heard rumors of a sequel , but given the years , i doubt it will happen . but , i would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared . if alicia is as evil , conniving and horrible as people say , then i do not think she will be thinking , ""yay ! i woke up from a coma ! oh , hadley was responsible ? oh ! that's okay ! i totally forgive her and want the charges dropped !

"can scarcely imagine a better movie than this hey , before you all go ""chick flick"" on me . i am a very large strong & masculine , macho man , who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years . the acting was superb and the story was marvelous . this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul . the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast . i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl , along with holly hunter , joan plowright , dame edith evans , sissy spacek , judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film . and of course cloris leachman ( also in this film ) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years . . at any rate this was an amazing cast . this film was like a book that you cannot lay down , and when you have reached the last page wish for more . . . still more . i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 3 . 9 that rating here is utterly amazing to me . or perhaps not . perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad . it makes me ever so sad that films like ""american beauty"" ""leaving las vegas"" ""sexy beast"" and ""fight club"" ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an ""r"" rating . . . r that is for ""rubbish"" . hey o . k . , i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences , but it is a sad commentary when this lovely , powerful . . . extraordinarily , directed , acted , and written film seems to be over looked . it obviously was at the academy awards as well . . . . how sad . and how predictable . my summation is that if you want to see a powerful , happy , sad , beautiful story ? watch . . . . . . preferably own this film . . .",1,10

". . . . and after seeing this pile of crap you will not be surprised that it was not published ! ! ! ! spoilers ! ! ! ! this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it is one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : "" my god . what happened here ? "" "" i do not know but they sure hate cats "" * the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you are going to be watching a bad movie the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it is very illogical and confused . we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town ? having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - that's the only thing we learn . we never learn how they are able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator . monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . i guess that is so the production team can come up with an ending . it was that they started the movie my complaint lies we're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis , clive barker and even stephen king make cameos . i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they were not going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . that's how bad sleepwalkers is * unbelievable as it seems that was not the worst line in the movie . the worst line is - "" that cat saved my life """,0,2

"i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren , whom i had not seen in any movies since rocky iv . unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment . the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr . lundgren , who was okay-ish . kata dob was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up . the plot is not at all clever , it is something that is been repeated a million times in different movies . the crooks were utterly stereotypical , and lundgren's character had not any depth in it . i did not really expect a movie masterpiece , but unfortunately this is not even decent action . every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over-the-top unrealism and comic-book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon . i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic-like action , but only if nothing else is available . 1/10 .

"well first off i'd like to add that i myself is somewhat of a historian so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts . but this is however not the case here . sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it is not entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying . hitler was not anti-semitic in his youth , he even worked for jews before world war one . it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews . his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate , hitler as a child was not a disturbed little brat . he had a more or less normal upbringing . nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitler . robert carlyle is a great actor but he does not really fit in the role as hitler . hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portrait-ed here . under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom ""manipulated"" people through his charms . his unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war . i'd like to see a film about hitler's life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations . i really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil . it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like ! the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this . because it seems as if they did not even know what really happened . hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in munch , his shoulder was ripped out of its socket . it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this .",0,3

"the woman in black ( 1989 ) is a tv adaptation of susan hill's modern classic ghost story , published only a few years earlier than the film was made . sadly , this film has not been released on dvd , and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs . it's availability is in direct contrast to it is popularity amongst those in the know about horror films . the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow , who died on her isolated marshland estate . what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death , and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest . the story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self-indulgent , flashy or over-expositional . the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach , but it is just what the story needs , and why it works so well . it's what you do not see that scares . having said that , there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual , and it works to perfection . i watched this film during the day , and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later . if you love being terrified , do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black .",1,10

"several features of this film immediately date it . the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years . the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques . bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career . i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression . i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me . somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers . as in so many of her character roles , bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred . leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress . towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street . they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them . this scene is possibly meant to be funny , but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film . it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face . and after all as far as we can see ( and hope for ) it is a happy ending .",1,7
"i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years , but i only got to see it early last year , when i went on an insane movie-buying binge , and , for whatever reason , it has been on my mind lately , though it is been some months since i watched it . it's a striking film , set in italy somewhere around the 15th century . definitely medieval-era ( though i do not think any specific year is ever given ) . this being the time of christian ascendancy , the age is a time of utter madness , and the movie captures this very well . flavia , our protagonist , is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield . he seems a warm and intriguing fellow , and she is immediately taken with him . her father , a soldier of a a family of some standing , comes along , almost immediately , and murders the wounded man right before her eyes . but she will continue to see him in her dreams . her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents , so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity , slowly go mad . flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns . but in a mad world , only the sane are truly mad , and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her . her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia , who , being young and apparently sheltered , is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped . the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world , showcasing a lot of unpleasantness . we see a horse gelded , a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty , the pious torture of a young nun . through it all , flavia observes and questions , rejecting , eventually , the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic . i disagree with that criticism . flavia's views , though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror , for example , then-contemporary feminist commentary ( the movie was made in 1974 ) , revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions . it is , perhaps , difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time , but that is the sort of minor point it does not do to belabor . flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era , or of any era , to empathize with her plight . getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees . flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive , invading the countryside , and she finds , in their leader , a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams . smitten with her almost immediately , he allows her to virtually lead his army , becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle-gear , and directing the invaders to pull down christian society , and wreak vengeance upon all those she is seen commit evil . is she the herald of a new and better world ? she may think so , but muslims of that era were not big on feminism , either , as she soon learns the hard way . as they say , meet the new boss . . . this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic . the movie is quite grim , and with a very downbeat , rather depressing ending . not a mass-audience movie at all , to be sure . it's quite good , though , and does not belong on the ""nunsploitation"" pile on which it is often carelessly thrown . i think there is much value in the final film , and i'm glad i saw it .",1,8

"what a great word ""re-imagining"" is . isn't that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv ( 2004 ) ? a clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate , ""remake"" that is , and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination . well , damn , was i misled . at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of ""re-imagining , "" though it played a role . still , why make a remake ? directors do it for only a few reasons really : to update a movie for a modern audience , or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it . an homage , if you will . nonetheless , it all generally ( i do admit exceptions ) boils down to one thing : stealing someone's idea and reshaping it ( or ""re-imagining"" it ) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it . it's like coles'/cliffs' notes; dump everything in a blender , purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors . in other words , a great marketing scheme . so what is wrong with this one ? well , i'll start with what i liked . i liked the opening scenes . thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means . we see the city in ruins , thousands of zombies : chaos and death . two words that look beautiful on screen . then it all falls apart . this set-up leads nowhere . the movie does what almost every remake does . it adds more of everything except character , atmosphere , and story . it's noisier , ( in some sense ) bloodier , and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots . the setting , the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme , is purely coincidental . the idea communicated in romero's film , the pure ecstatic joy of having ""a mall all to yourself as a fortress , "" is gone here . further , this ""re-imagining"" has no moxie , no spirit , no balls . it assumes ( probably quite rightly ) that the audience has no attention span and does not bother to get us interested in the characters or the story . the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original . you actually grew to care about those people in romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall . here , you do not care when or who goes : what matters is how they go . what else is their to say ? the film is not scary . it has one or two ""jump"" scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects . as a story it is really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it . the humor is also reduced to a few one-liners ( and one really good character : andy ) . after that , what remains ? an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued , inevitable ambiguity of the original film . but , despite it being a pretty bad film ( though not quite as bad as some other remakes ) , it should be remembered for one thing : it kicked the passion of christ from it is number one spot in the box office . well done zombies .",0,4
"a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion , to make a low-budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century . even with warnings by the caretaker , the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house . one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead , and use some of the passages from it for their script . but in doing so , when red they raise a ghoul from its grave . boring , confusing and tacky all rolled up into one , equals this penniless midnight horror production . what feels like an eternity , it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas . even though director paul harrison's clunky , tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie , moody and atmospheric set-pieces . but laziness did set it early . the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest . nor is it fun . think of bob clark's ""children shouldn't play with dead things ( 1972 ) "" , and now we have got older actors in the part . however i found ""seven corpses"" to be inferior . the script early on has some cutting wit abound , before it ends up being drab , predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities . the cheap foundation involving limited sets did not help matters either , but the mansion's dreary , dark appearance had a creepy air to it . performances from a recognizable b-cast is mainly rigid . john carradine in small part mainly lurks about . john ireland plays a hot-headed director , faith domergue's washed-up actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up . the slow grinding premise is crossed between ""ten little indians"" and your usual zombie set-up . however its not all that engaging , even with its occult and supernatural edge . hell they even throw in some graveyard action , with no prevail . when the rotting ghoul makes its appearance finally , but a bit late . it does get a little better , if very baffling . just like the inspired opening , the ending is deliciously downbeat . to bad in between , it constantly drags . continuity in many scenes comes across non-existent , and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier ( but indeed poorly executed ) in the movie they are making , then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears . the generic music score flounders on with its shuddery , but frank gothic cues , and the camera-work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination . shoot and frame . shoot and frame . job done . that's a wrap .",0,3

"after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times , there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama , ""read my lips"" . having written over five hundred reviews , i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard's subtle , yet inspirational love story . thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film , and while the ""loves"" overpowered , it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind . ""read my lips"" is a drama . to be more precise , is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work . here is where this review begins to crumble , it is all of these items but it is more much , much more . as a viewer , you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla , whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty . audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid , causing an immediate unrest , not only from the characters within the film , but to those watching . without sound , the world is left open to any possibility , and that is frightening . as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life , we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul ( played exquisitely by vincent cassel ) , a slicked-back hair , mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison , homeless , jobless , and forced by his parole officer to get a job . this is how carla and paul meet . there is that moment of instant , unsettling attraction . the one where we think she loves him , but he is dark ( and here is where it gets even more fun ) and where we think he loves her , but she is dark . the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown . who , as viewers , are we to feel the most sympathy for ? paul sleeps in the office , carla helps him; carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker , paul helps her; carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for paul . the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair , waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave . it never does . audiard cannot just allow this story to take place , he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next . even our rock , our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing a subplot to this film that at first angered me , but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film . yet none of this could have happened if it were not for our characters . devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking , as she changes her image for paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered . paul , the wildcard in the film , continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame . then , just as we assume one , carla takes on one last shape . audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters . cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair . the story , probably the weakest part of this film , is at first random . the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first , but audiard lets them connect bit by bit . again , the entire parole officer segment was tangent , but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means . not attempting to sound vague , but this complex ( yet utterly simple ) story is difficult to explain . there is plenty happening , but it is up to you to connect the pieces . a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held . that use of sound and scene was brilliant . it was tense , it was dramatic , and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes . overall , i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over i was proved wrong . ""read my lips"" opens the floor for discussion , not just with the characters , but the situations . one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene , and paul in the next . when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla , i found myself deeply angry . audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development , and what he was lacking in plot the actors were able to carry . i can easily suggest this film to anyone , but be prepared; this is not a one time viewing film . repeat . repeat . repeat . grade : **** out of *****",1,8

"maybe it is the dubbing , or maybe it is the endless scenes of people crying , moaning or otherwise carrying on , but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought ( and therefore annoying ) films i've ever seen . the film starts out promisingly if familiarly , as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son ( sandro franchina ) . whilst mummy and daddy ( bland alexander knox ) entertain their guests at a dinner party , the youngster tries to kill himself , setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy . spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ( ettore giannini ) , she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband , who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles . bergman plays the saint role to the hilt , echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc , and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect . unfortunately , the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety , as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes . by the final tear soaked scene , i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters . a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st . francis .",0,4

( it's interesting to note , parenthetically , that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career; fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence , keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers . ) the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe , heartbreaking in the title role . he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage , making the last line of kipling's poem ring true . he is unforgettable . montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major , whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru . the rest of the cast , joan fontaine , robert coote , lumsden hare , are effective but have little to do . movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine's father . the film picks its villains well . the demonic thuggee cult , worshipers of the hideous , blood-soaked kali , hindu goddess of destruction , was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries , ritualistically strangling up to 30 , 000 victims a year . in 1840 the british military , in cooperation with a number of princely states , succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion . henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares .",1,10
"i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc . after 30 minutes , i said to him , "" you've got to be kidding . is this some sort of joke ? "" he thought it was good . i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made . ""what was it supposed to be ? "" i asked . ""a propaganda movie made for children ? "" the plot is stupid . the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life , love or even afterlife , of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view . . . need some psychiatric help . please , if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player , consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer . . . it will not destroy your player but it will destroy your evening . if they had made razzies in the '40s , this would have won in every category .

"""the plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b . demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual . it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok ( gary cooper ) , buffalo bill cody ( james ellison ) , calamity jane ( jean arthur ) , george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact , even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place . every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth , but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship . the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people , who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends . truly , this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment , but a pretty campy relic by today's standards . transfer : considering the vintage of the film , this is a moderately appealing transfer , with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks . there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments . all in all , the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent , but it is never all bad or all good just a bit better than middle of the road . age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract . the audio is mono but nicely balanced . extras : forget it . it's universal ! bottom line : as pseudo-history painted on celluloid , this western is compelling and fun . just take its characters and story with a grain of salt in some cases a whole box seems more appropriate !",1,7

"this is a great film for mccartney's and beatles fans ! a splendid time is guaranteed for all . the audience ( feat some celebrities such as nicholson , cuzak , michael douglas ) is , as always , quite amazing : from small children to old campaigners of the sixties . they know the words to all the songs by heart , and some of them are crying when paul breaks into ""blackbird"" ""yesterday "" ""all my loving"" and all the treasures of his catalog ( who , except john lennon and dylan , can claim such a repertoire ? ) . there are two particularly moving moments : -the double tribute to lennon and harrison;first ""here today"" performed solo ( the title was included in ""tug of war"" 1982 and was its best track ) , then ""something"" when paul uses an ukulele . -""the long and winding road"" rendition , a key moment , when paul's voice cracks , as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage . i remember , in the early seventies , when people used to despise paul , cause he was not involved in politics , as his ex-partner was . they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist : ""fame is great cause it allows charity"" . the film shows different aspects of paul's activities , an artist who is anything but selfish .",1,7
"this movie is not funny . it just takes the d&d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them . all the main characters make less than 30k a year , they all live with their parents , they are all socially retarded , and they have no luck with women . the jokes are horrible and unimaginative , such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on ( it was his wizard costume ) and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up ( oh how funny , he is a nerd so he does not know about sports ) . you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny . poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch , but obviously extremely cheap to make . i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo . i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime .",0,2
"i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies . i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted . to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot , the most suspense , surprises , most emotional , ( especially the ending ) and definitely the most episodic movie . i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving , was not as episodic , and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie . it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole . i have heard many strange reasons such as : a ) because yoda died b ) because bobba fett died c ) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d ) because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely . first off , who cares if bobba fett died ? ? ? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die . don't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be . his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie . . . you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name ! ! ! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think . . . secondly , many fans did not like yoda dying . sure , it was a momentous period in the movie . i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic . all the good guys cannot stay alive in a realistic movie , you know . otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon . another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda's death . . well , nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope . ( many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy ) why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not . . . hmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . . another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible . that is utterly ridiculous ! ! i can not believe this one ! ! first off , the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there . if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage . ( since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage ) they had swinging vines , ropes , logs set up to trip those walkers , and other traps . the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest . the only thing they had was their blasters . to add , it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves , they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest . i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros , the band of rebels , as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain , that would have been a great upset . lastly , if this scene was still unbelievable to you . . how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo , chewbacca , and the princess , being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view ! ! and not only that , the heroes , of course , always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters . the troopers must have very , very bad aim then ! at least in empire strikes back , the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers . don't believe me ? check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando's base . or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at ( somehow they missed ) as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star . the last reason that i care to discuss ( others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here . ) is that people did not like darth vader being revealed ! well , in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie . luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father , annakin skywalker . it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete . by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side ( in his helmet ) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker ( by removing the helmet ) . the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about . in fact , that is is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father . . . isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet ? on another note , i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse ( even if it is better ) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves . i never go into a film with that deception in mind , i always try to go into a film with the attitude that ""well , it might be better or worse that the original . . but i can not know for sure . . let's see . "" that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was . i am not sure who criticizes these movies but , i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me ( except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite ) that it is rotj . i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading . bottom line , the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy . this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes . there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful , exciting , surprising , or all of the above . for example , the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day ! ! ! finally , i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky , insignificant details ( or see it as ""just another sequel"" ) to trash the movie such as ""this movie stinks because luke is not in it ! "" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately .",1,10
"this movie is bad ! it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video , only worse ! the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint , freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling . i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie .",0,1
"i had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews . then . . . . here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted , excellent 'lost in translation' review . premise : morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket . can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash life ? realistic dialog ? not . how about that shopping in target . first , freeman looks at the target interior as if he is walked into harrods . then , he is bowled over at a t-shirt rack confirming he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet . morgan is detached from any and all aspects of scarlet us reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in scarlet us life . one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene where her survival , a car in this instance , requires she physically attack her ex hubbie . does freeman run to her defense . . . . naw . . . he is cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real , sorry lot in life . freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing , tight fitting blouse is the key to scarlet us job interview . another sign that freeman is clueless . freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of scarlet us reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating . freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis : uneducated , no white collar skills or experience , very poor , no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem . scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as : some people pay $100 for a t-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills . in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star' , not even paying for gas for scarlet us dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know .",0,4

"american playwright howard w . campbell , jr . ( played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte ) lives happily in germany with his actress wife , helga noth ( sheryl lee ) before the beginning of world war ii . at the peak of his life , howard is drafted by an american agent ( john goodman ) to become a spy on behalf of the allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds , howard has everything to lose , but finds the offer irresistible . following the death of his wife and the end of the war , campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city , which muddies his neuroses even further . the central question ( indeed , a question that has frustrated many critics ) of the movie and kurt vonnegut's source novel is , ""is campbell a hero or a traitor ? "" director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b . weide offer us clues , but no answer , and this ambiguity this not knowing is what keeps ""mother night"" fresh and interesting throughout . at the beginning of the film , nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end , he is either scared and uncertain , or scared and completely certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war . gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half , which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonnegut's dramatic side . on the flip side , when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment ( which he affectionately calls ""purgatory"" ) only to be discovered by a group of nazis , the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author , and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds . the moral ( even spiritual ) paradox ""mother night"" presents does not lend itself to simple resolution , and to a degree , should be left ambiguous the black-and-white scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy to as campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him , coming back to america changes him , and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his ""act"" even further , to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall , spewing anti-semitic bile . perhaps that is the best reaction we could hope for .",1,7

"i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona did not have fair hair like almost always . the cast played very well , too , and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so faithfully . but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona . i have always thought she is very modest , and that is why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio - although it was happening only in othello's imagination . at first , i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly . but as a whole , i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene .",1,8

"i enjoyed this film . but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy . it was amusing at times , but really , it was not very funny at all . if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy , i might have been disappointed with the film , but , going in with no expectations , i found it to be enjoyable and engaging . maybe it was because , as an engineer , i identified with the protagonist . i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor , and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention . a man who is less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production . he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention . so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park; me , i compare it to the fountainhead .",1,7

"en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track ( but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway ) , a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination . the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area : in the first story , an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband , but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story , a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on . the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea , but with only two stories , it falls woefully short . and that is not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver : the acting is lousy ( with joe haggerty , as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson , giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen ) ; the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending . . . . well , that beggars belief . to be fair , some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective ( although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused ) and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic : an ear is bitten off , eyeballs are plucked out , a face is removed , brains are squished , and there is a messy decapitation . these positives just about make the film bearable , but be warned , the zombie chronicles am not a stroll in the park , even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash . i give the zombie chronicles 2/10 , but generously raise my rating to 3 since i did not get to view the film with the benefit of 3d ( although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension would not have made that much of a difference ) .",0,3
"once upon a time , there were different types of movies . these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer . . . . this seems obvious at first , but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten . this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans . that's all it is . it does not claim to be anything else or anything grander . people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise are not seeing the whole picture- literally . after all , hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people ( bodyguard or the preacher's wife w/whitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mind . ) first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti . there are worse things in this world-- and worse movies . the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun . the movie starts with schubert's ave maria and then leoncavallo's matinatta . pav sings arias from la gioconda , manon lescaut , and turandot but also sings popular music such as ""i left my heart in san francisco"" and the song that was nominated for an oscar & golden globe , ""if we were in love"" w/music by john williams & lyrics by alan & marilyn bergman- all 3 previous oscar winners . the story is not that bad . it was built for pavarotti so of course it is not going to be something that is profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer . it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago . when asked to sing again at the same place , the ""met"" in nyc , he loses his voice from fear . doctor pamela ( or pah-may-lah in italian : ) ) played by kathryn harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction . he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts . they embark on an affair , she knowing he is married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman . despite all that , they fall in love ( thus the song , ""if we were in love"" ) and with her help , he overcomes his fear & goes back to the met where he triumphs . i will not tell how it ends , but it is fairly predictable . which is not always a bad thing . the performances in this are not that bad . pavarotti ( who plays giorgio fini ) is not an actor , so if you are expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance , you are deluded , not pavarotti . he knows he is not a thespian . what he is is cute , charming & charismatic . he is having fun himself , and if you can just let yourself have fun too , it is not so bad . one funny line is when he tells pamela ( harrold ) that she is a ""thirsty plant , fini can water you ! "" and of course , she says , ""i do not want to be watered on by fini ! "" kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi-uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little . one of my favorite lines in the movie is : ""life never has to be life size . "" and there is eddie albert who does his usual good job as fini's manager . there are several ""themselves"" cameos by real conductors , singers , etc . and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center . if you like opera , if you like pavarotti , or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a ""little fling"" just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is . i know i do- every time . : )",1,7

"director/star clint eastwood's ""sudden impact"" is an intriguing addition to the ""dirty harry"" series - a combination of crude film-making and genius . it's mediocre and silly in parts , brilliant and classic in others , with compelling , gripping pacing . there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up ""make my day"" scene recalls the ""do you feel lucky"" one , one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio , an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner - just to name a few . harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department , still mean , still tough , but now he is older and wearier . his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice , the two things not always being compatible . this ""incompatibility"" is the underlying theme of the series . the first film posed a simple question , ""what about the victim's rights ? "" - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ? vice versa ? depends ? ) . that film's answer was controversial , prompting a sequel ( the highly enjoyable ""magnum force"" ) which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure , heartless vigilantism . dirty harry , like many of clint's other roles , is the personification of vengeance , the protector of the the defenseless . this movie however brings it back to the victim , in this case jennifer ( portrayed by sondra locke ) , who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men ( and one woman ) who committed the crime . without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie , i will say this - i mentioned earlier that ""sudden impact"" echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series ( the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank , i believe ) . the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante ? and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights ? the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series , one which i personally ( as a fan ) found quite moving . that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the ""dirty harry"" collection , the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film . ( not to knock ""the dead pool"" - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan , rather than a character-defining film like this one ) . this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing , and the president himself frequently quoted ""go ahead , make my day .

"let's hope this is the final nightmare . this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad . okay , there is still some enjoyment to be had , but only in the most mundane sense . rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise , had been on the production staff and produced even . i do not know what she was thinking , but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by tom and roseanne arnold ! i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote/directed this disappointing piece of garbage . she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror , with the contrived use of a 3d ending . aren't those glasses nifty ? and you get to keep them ! it's the equivalent of , you just spent $9 . 00 making me rich . here's 10 cents . now , do not you feel special ! ? sorry , but for me , it just did not make me feel special . and freddy's had yet another face-lift . this one was for the worst , i think . all the beautiful artistry that went into his ""look"" in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper , less detailed set of prosthetics . he looks . . . less like the burn victim he is supposed to be , and more like he has a skin disorder . changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor . but wait ! they've done that , and done that . so i guess it does not matter . but it mattered to me . freddy is no longer scary . he's just . . . another low-rent monster like the leprechaun . it's more . . . a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee ( sadly , it fell short on both accounts ) . so there is nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh , because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film . it rates a 3 . 2/10 from . . . the fiend : .",0,3

"legend of zu i remember well tsui hark's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier . over one christmas , on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies , zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable , that it is been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog . . . in fact , i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from . and the memories of seeing yuen biao , sammo hung and others in their classic prime . so when i saw this remake of zu warriors , there was a feeling of apprehension . could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original , or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies ? well the answer is i cannot say . but that was because this is not really a remake . the stories ( and styles ) are almost completely different . the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky , a lone warrior , whose master , dawn , declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia . two hundred years later , insomnia returns , dawn is reincarnated as enigma , and insomnia has returned to destroy zu . meanwhile white eyebrows and red try , with the help of king sky , to stop insomnia . the plot is not one full of twists and turns , but had enough detail in it to keep me interested . but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate . the film is very much about the special effects , with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments , much like the storm riders and a man called hero . but unlike the other two , this film was one which did not overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful . nothing appears rushed - unlike hero . the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes . the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing . it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks' , but generally each character had its part in the story . but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion , and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this . ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film , but i could not say this film showed their best performances . cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting , but it is still quite raw . kelly lin was the new revelation for me . despite her very short role , i have apologise and admit to ogling ! overall , i have to say , did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original' . given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark , the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades . and one beauty of that is the fact that you cannot really compare the two films at all , as much as apples are apples and pears are pears . ultimately , both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right . and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again . two to watch , but not compare .",1,8
"well now , this was certainly a surprise episode . in this anthology science fiction series , with all of this alien beings , extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter , this episode would certainly rate as unusual . its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story's end . or does it ? kicking off with the silent movie form , no recorded dialog , but having musical accompaniment . in this case it is on the sound track , not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician . this part of the episode , along with the ending section , also made liberal use o title cards , just like ""the old time movies . "" while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone , they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film . veteran comedy film director , norman z . mcleod , was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment . he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time , featuring people like the marx brothers , w . c . fields , harold lloyd and danny kaye . he was no stranger to to tv , as he had done a lot of work on television series . it does not appear that he and mr . keaton had ever worked together before ( as i cannot find any evidence of this ) ' but judging by the outcome of the film , they succeeded in doing so with flying colors ! anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player . he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it . their short partnership must have been a harmonious one , with 'give and take' about how to do things . it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton's , resurrected from his own silent picture days . for example , the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo's ( stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe ""fatty"" arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers , the garage ( 1919 ) . that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell . buster knew that we film our world with a camera , rendering it a two dimensional image . this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags . it is a cardinal rule for his film making . the cast was small and once again just chock full-of veteran talent . stanley adams was rollo and served as mr . keaton's straight man . jesse white , the old 'maytag repair man' , ran the fix it shop that fixed the 'time hjelmet' . gil lamb , serene veteran of rko short comedy series , was the 1890's cop . james flavin , george e . stone , harry fleer , warren parker , and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast . without spilling the beans , let us just say that yes , there is probably a lesson to be learned here . if not the one already mentioned , ""the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence ! "" , then how about , ""be careful in what you ask for , because you just may get it ! """,1,10
"i'll admit that i liked the first one , and was really looking forward to the sequel . i was let down . sure the special effects were technically amazing -- but they were not believable looking . it looked more like a cartoon . alright , i admit to liking 80% of the chase scene -- but the fight with all the mr smiths ? it was too obviously animated . i can accept all of that . what i cannot accept is that the non-action parts were crap . every time morpheus opened his mouth , i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing . i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist . what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie ( except about the existence of the matrix ) . this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream . ugh ! i want my $7 . 00 back !",0,2

"i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon . though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s , the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention , and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end . i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film ( oops , did not notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior ) , and was very pleased to be able to watch it again ( and in its entirety ) . i do not wholly understand the phenomenon , but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary . the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons , but are they actually scary ? no , not very . likewise in the years since the 70s we have gotten horror movies that are cooler , more exciting , have much better production values and sophisticated special effects , are more fun , funnier , have effective ""jump"" moments , and some very creative uses of gore , but again . . . they are not really scary ! there's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films . the grainy film quality . the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs . the ""edge of dreamland"" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq'd scores . the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything . everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s , in the case of horror , works in its favor . specifically , in this film , the quiet , intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving . so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling , slavering , and overtly hostile ( ""cujo"" ? ) . the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form . the effects when that occurs , while unsophisticated by today's standards , literally gave me chills . the bizarre , vaguely-defined , ""i'm not quite sure what i'm looking at"" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be , rather than the hyper-real , crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films . while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit , the actors all do a decent job . the pairing of the brother and sister from the ""witch mountain"" movies as , yes , brother and sister , is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting , but they do fine . yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular . richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses . his self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he is merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled , though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he is been experiencing is absurd in its na vet . the movie's the-end-question-mark type ending is one of the only ones i've seen that does not feel like a cheap gimmick , and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they would be likely to do and how they would feel about it . detractors of this film may say it is merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots , but hey , you could say the same thing about ""blade runner"" . : - )",1,7
"although the actors were good , specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly , the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary . a famous theatre director ( hilmir sn r gu nason ) , becoming blind after a car accident , is on the run for himself and his destiny . lilly , being sightless since her birth , is teacher for blind persons , and wants to make him ""seeing"" again . ( blind persons are seeing with their fingers , nose and ears . ) here this movie is becoming a roadmovie; and the longer the road becomes , the closer their relation develops , which was predictable since the beginning of the film . the theatre director is on the road to his mother ( jenny gr llmann ) . his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations - of course , what should she do other ! - and she is still living , because she is waiting his son , to die . my god ! this are destinies ! finally the son arrived ! mum is celebrating a big party ! at the beach . wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune . yes , they are celebrating her farewell . the son arrives just in time . mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse . now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son , speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german , while the son is answering with a rough accent . because the son is unable to see , he is not falling in love to the nurse , - the film script would have become also too complicate ! - but is looking for lilly on the way back to home . parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly , staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her , who has first to booze himself to courage . the occasion is favourable . because mum ( tina engel ) is on journey together with the lover of lilly , paul ( harald schrott ) . they are after lilly , to bring her back . paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love , because the film script would have become too complicate . the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too . i would suggest an architect or a pianist , or course a famous one ! when they finally find lilly , they want to convince her , to come back to paul , because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her . but lilly felt in love to his pupil , the theatre director; did i mention , that he was even a famous theatre director ? this is german film art ! as you may see in this pretentious production , that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films , because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films . this film is really embarrassing . i have the impression , that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants . everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea . probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit , being a co-producer . i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness : ""barfuss"" - already the spelling of the title is not right !

"to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart . though it is a very different kind of film , the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well . roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set , but some things never seemed to change . scottland is still run by english nobles , and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them . rob roy is handsomely done , but not the grand epic that braveheart was . there are no large-scale battles , and the conflict here is more between individuals . and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time . rob roy is simply a film about those with honor , and those who are truly evil . liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor . he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose ( john hurt ) . things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching , and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone . rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own . he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community . sounds fair enough , does not it ? problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves . one of them , known as archibald cunningham , is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film . played wonderfully by tim roth , this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother . this man is disgustingly effeminate , rude , heartless , and very dangerous with a sword . he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility . he rapes macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home . this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come . along with another crony of the marquis ( brian cox ) cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts . though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened , the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt . this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity . spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! ! luckily for the macgregor's , a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all . this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed . cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace . and for most of the fight , it looks like these attributes will win out . just when it looks like rob roy is finished , he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner . the first time you see what happens , you will probably be as shocked as cunningham ! rob roy is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and perfectly paced . the score is quite memorable , too . the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange , who might seem to be out of her element , actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor . the film is violent , but there is not too much gore . it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior , however . the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy . the film has no obvious flaws , thus it gets 10 of 10 stars . the hound .",1,10

"considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's , personal best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between hemingway ( chris cahill ) and donnelly ( tory skinner ) as a more than experimental phase of cahill's life . it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers . also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole . this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie . i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie ( the 1980 oregon track and field competition ) . this review may seem harsh , but it is the truth . the exploitation of young muriel hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film . pepper thompson",0,3

"i am extremely picky about the films i see . i'd heard about moon child completely by accident . i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently . i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought . being as critical as i am about films , i will admit , the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times . . . but they are meant too be , as another user suggested , it is the quintessential calm before the storm , quoting gary oldman from leon . . . without getting into the spoilers , the film hit me extremely hard , because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say , true friendship is loyalty and like marriage , it is until death do you part . hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics , their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally . upon seeing the film for the first time , i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes . i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film . . . this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's ""audition"" and ""suicide club"" fame ? man . . i just cannot say enough about this film , but i'll stop here . 10/10",1,10
okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious . some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot . unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year . don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely . the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together . so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now .,0,3
"there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl , but by spielmann and other directors as well . this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie . hundstage is no exception . this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing . in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing , but real people instead . so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer . . . almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block . any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern/sudern ( complaining ) , their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys . this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is , according to many , especially made for complaining as a way of life . a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed . the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens . moreover , they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores . inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure-giving activities , trying to stay in touch with their human selves , yet in vain . the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape , the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers . the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality/abnormality of its images only . another typical feature of seidl ( and other austrian directors ) is his showing of disturbingly sexual images . these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband , the sexual scenes in the bath , the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment , etc . in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris , new york or madrid . the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation , albeit in different circumstances . in the end , i believe seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage . and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation , seidl has achieved his goal .",1,10
"this was without a doubt the best of the ""dirty harry"" series . from the opening credits , you are swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing . sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge . eastwood has many ""aside"" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot , but show harry at his bad-assed best . loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles , this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks . this is the one dirty harry flick that is raw and devoid of any ""fluff"" . i can watch this again and again ( okay , not in one sitting ) because it is a gratifying ""out for revenge"" yarn . the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable .

"***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** released in 1956 , and considered quite racy at the time , douglas sirk's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing . the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle , who is insecure , weak , wounded & very alcoholic , played by robert stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone . ms . malone's performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes , which she uses to show us her emotions , which mostly consist of lust ( for rock hudson ) and jealousy ( for lauren bacall ) . malone is the only actress i've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first . now do not get me wrong , her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot , and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950's . but it is also terrible , because as likeable and attractive as malone is , she is not a very good actress , and she is not capable of subtly or shading . her performace is of one note . she does get to do a wicked mambo , and in a great montage , as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase , sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses . stack , ( who should have won an oscar ) & malone , ( who won the award , but should not have ) are the real stars of the film , the ones who set all the hysteria , both sexual & otherwise in motion , while the ""real stars"" of the film , hudson & bacall fade to grey & brown , which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in . hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood & best friend of stack's , and the stalked love interest of malone's who moans & groans over rock through most of the film . but hudson wants no part of her , and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack . no one is very happy & no one is happy for very long . the stack-bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year , and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile , and cannot give bacall a baby to prove that he is a man . sirk who was a very intelligent man , and had a long & fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany , ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950's with a series of intense vividly colored ""women's movies"" or melodramas . although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material , in sirk's hands they became masterpieces of the genre . sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations & lighting , make believe shadows , and lots of mirroed reflections . in ""written"" the characters are always peeking out of windows , listening at doors or sneaking around . so in the end , after much violence , an accidental murder , a miscarriage & more sirk ends the movie with a final & startling scene of a ""reborn"" and reformed malone in a man-tailored suit , sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell .",1,10
"new york , i love you , or rather should-be-titled manhattan , i love looking at your people in sometimes love , is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation . case in point , look at two of the segments in the film , one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk , and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books . while the latter is not a great story by any stretch , it is at least something that has a beginning , middle and end , as the composer tries to score , gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap , and in the end gets some help ( and maybe something more ) from a girl he is been talking to as a liaison between him and the director . the ethan hawke scene , however , is like nothing , and feels like it , like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in ( or , for that matter , hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites ) . what's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ( i . e . bits involving bradley cooper , drea dematteo , hayden christensen , andy garcia , james caan , natalie portman , etc ) . it's not even so much that the film- set practically always in *manhattan* and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx ( not even , say , harlem or washington heights ) - lacks a good deal of diversity , since there is some . it's the lack of imagination that one found in spades , for better or worse , in paris j'taime . it's mostly got little to do with new york , except for passing references , and at its worst ( the julie christie/shia labeouf segment ) it is incomprehensible on a level that is appalling . so , basically , wait for tv , and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in , that is , for three scenes : the aforementioned bloom/christina ricci segment which is charming; the brett ratner directed segment ( yes , x-men 3 brett ratner ) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary . everything else can be missed , even natalie portman's directorial debut , and the return of a hughes brother ( only one , allan ) to the screen . a mixed bag is putting it lightly : it is like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left .",0,4

"i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania . this tells something certainly about the value , or maybe about the lack of universality of the film , but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries , even in eastern europe . the film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda , a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published . it tells the story of an intellectual , professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the stalinist era . basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison , the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released . his release is actually only apparent , romania of the 60s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes , but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison . the film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actors . stefan iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega-star , we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art . although suffering from a hesitant story-telling and falling sometimes in non-essential details or character comics , the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema , as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society .",1,7
"a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty ( a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore ) which leaves him hideously disfigured . five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion . of course , an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors . writers/directors mark ezra , peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clich s which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun : fake jump scares , prowling steadican shots , a fierce storm , an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack , a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity , a totally ridiculous ""what the hell ? "" supernatural climax , tacky make-up f/x , and one of those lovably lame ""it was all just a terrible dream"" fake-out non-endings . moreover , the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods : gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer , a lady taking an acid bath , a guy being crushed under a huge tractor , and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex . thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick . the cast all give solid performances , with especially stand-out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack , billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank , and donna yeager as foul-mouthed slut stella . co-producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny . harry manfredini's moody , rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his ""friday the 13th"" scores . alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick . good , trashy fun .",1,8
"this is one of my all-time favorite films , and while it may move too slowly for some , it is well worth seeing . a corporate lawyer ( richard chamberlain ) is dragged into a case involving ""city"" aborigines , and this is no ordinary case . ok , a man has died but it was not exactly a normal killing . there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive . the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans . this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about ""city"" vs . ""tribal"" aborigines , and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways . uh huh . chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what is happening , although no matter how many times i've seen this i cannot quite grasp the exact connection . this is a very eerie and creepy film , and is a fine example of peter weir's ability to create tension out of nothing . the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally , it is the easiest way out and the scariest . 10 out of 10 and highly recommended .",1,10

"""let's bowl"" started out on local television in the twin cities . it came on late at night , something you would stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of hamm's . even the ads were locally produced , featuring wally outside grumpy's bar , holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- ""ahh . . . over to you , steve sedahl . "" not sure why , but that one always made me laugh . there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers , but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips . sedahl played it straight , counter-balanced by rich kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious ""wally hotvedt . "" highlights included segments like ""how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball"" ( chuck them into a lake ) and ""tips on dating , "" where the duo ""date"" a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint , ""i could have done that myself ! "" another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured steve in beer can strewn hovel , pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylor's falls , dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones . hilarious ! wally's awestruck comments about ""league bowlers , "" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights . ""let's bowl"" was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments , but the network never really knew what to do with it , running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling ""competition , "" which was never the point of the show . the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ( ernie , the pig , butch , etc . ) were more distractions than anything else . the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced . even jon stewart dissed let's bowl on the daily show -- ( not enough lame , snide jokes ? ) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better . how often does a ""let's bowl"" come along in the world of modern television , a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap ? the networks have the ""total crap"" part down cold , but it is a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark , strange , funny little gem like ""let's bowl .

"this mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations . sotd falls somewhere between ""kung-fu"" and ""h r pufnstuff"" on the entertainment spectrum . if it were not so long ( nearly 3 hours ) i think that kids would like it quite a bit . it's got adventure , action , ""cliffhanger scenes"" , and not too much romance or other ""icky"" stuff . when you are young , you are not too critical of flexing rubber swords , campy acting , and scenes that are repeated .

"""igor and the lunatics"" is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie . apparently even nearly twenty years later , charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers . this is a typical troma production , meaning in other words , there is a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot . there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display which is not bad but it is all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at . ""igor and the lunatics"" is so desperate that it is even using a lot of the footage twice , like the circle saw killing for example . the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul . one of paul's lower ranked disciples , named igor , becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity . just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is : he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl ! there's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks , like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences . maybe there is one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete . for no particular reason , the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds .",0,2

"a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort ""the divorce of lady x ( 1938 ) "" . it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon , before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors . and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy , it all flows along nicely . oberon is leslie , a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan's ( olivier ) hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel . she does everything possible to irritate him--but , in the crazy way films go , he falls for her . and she falls for him . but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon's ""lady x"" ( that is all she leaves oliver in a note ) is thought by olivier to be a married woman . to make matters worse , and more amusing , lord mere ( ralph richardson ) goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon ! there is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue , and fun exploration of sexual politics . you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy , but in true olivier he is a consummate professional , and delivers . and he handles the screwball twists and turns , maybe not with ease , but with gusto . oberon was no great shakes as an actress , but she was usually competent enough , and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her , worked well with olivier . this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today ( everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson ) , but perhaps the print needs cleaning up .",1,7

! ! ! ! ! of course there's spoilers ! ! ! ! ! i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clich s in horror movies : female protagonist - check bad things happen to drug takers - check heorine knocks out villain - check heroine does not notice villain recovering unconsciousness - check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this clich list to a film studio instead of using it for class . dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clich s turning up here . in fact there is so many clich s and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he is been killing people on the underground . i'm led to believe it is the result of some human experiment and perhaps it is not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they would be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there is always a market for horror movies . likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it is slightly better than 1972's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground . it is just that when you think all the clich s have been used up in this film another clich comes along to raise its ugly head,0,4
"small spoilers alert ! ! ! good movie . . . very good movie . and i'm surprised to say that myself , because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news . most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen . this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action . this movie really fascinated me . good accomplishment , seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved . it really is the story that keeps you focused . especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied . sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth . it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle . of course , that is where the reality and the ""based on a true story"" stops . the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker . in this movie , the count ( vlad teppish ) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman . and they are all pretty girls , i'll give him that . overall , good acting by unknown faces , enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline . this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore . but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr . heck , it is a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title . these two films have nothing else in common , but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture . check it out . . . my humble opinion on to die for = 8 . 5/10",1,9

"i first saw this mini-series a number of years ago on british television and was immediately captivated by the story . this rather surprised me as i am not a great fan of either 'jane eyre' or 'wuthering heights'; i consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous bore , and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap . 'the tenant of wildfell hall' , like the aforementioned works , is also somewhat depressing in parts . however , the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of helen's escape , the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of yorkshire , and the sexual magnetism of toby stephens . this film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time . at best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the markham household . at the other end of the scale , there is the unfortunate helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate , but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect . she runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but , as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community , she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation . tara fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering helen markham . not only incredibly beautiful ( in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle ) with the most amazing cheekbones , she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film . tara is dignified and aloof while , at the same time , allowing us to see that helen is still dangerously vulnerable . rupert graves is the depraved , yet curiously attractive arthur huntingdon - after seeing him , i could never imagine another actor playing that part . pam ferris deserves special mention for her role as gilbert's indulgent mother , as does the actress who played his sister rose , and simon carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the good things in life . finally , i could watch this film for toby stephens alone; he is so good-looking , rugged , sexy , sensitive ( but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way ) . i am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively ! if there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which i felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing . other people , who have watched this film with me , also had problems with this , and i found i had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective . i am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film . not only did i puchase the video ( a rare occurrence ) , but it led me to buy anne bronte's superb novel . naturally , this was better than the film , but only by a narrow margin . i recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order .",1,8
"takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film , because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love : visitor q , gozu , izo , ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy . lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he is succeeding . still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction , so i was nervous . of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did . great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too . the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child : neverending story , labyrinth , return to oz , etc . i enjoyed those films because they did not treat kids like they are stupid and this one does not either . the dark underlying morals are there , but , it is also as silly as any kids film should be . i personally was not bothered by the cgi and prosthetics . i feel like they fit well and do not think kids will notice . if you are a die hard takashi miike fan , you may not like this one . but , i suggest giving it a shot . it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is . he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones , which is very reassuring . to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one , i suggest these other miike films : 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china . ' good job takashi miike ! 8/10 stars .",1,8
"a comedy gem . lots of laugh out loud moments , the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably . the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - i know people like this ! the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film ( this may sound strange ) puts me in mind of an ealing comedy . it's a quirky little film with lots of detail . it certainly takes a number of viewings . i've watched it a few times ( i've been showing all my friends ! ) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue , something visual that i had not picked up on before . i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun , feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy . it is a film which will find it is friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there . oh . . . . and it has a great soundtrack .",1,10

"as a kid , my friends and i all believed that gymkata was the most violent , bloody movie ever made . i'm not sure who started that rumor . it was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who were not allowed to see it for one reason or other . years after gymkata was released , it became a perennial late night cable movie , and as a result , i've been able to make up for lost time . i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times , and i can always spot it from 1-2 seconds of screen time . however , aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts , the bad dubbing , the stiff dialog , and the outrageously difficult story-line , the film has some things going for it . with all that is bad about the movie visually , the sound is actually pretty entertaining . never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume ! the canned kung-fu sounds are cheeky , but the slowed and pitched-down music , and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird . the chase through the city of demented , blood-thirsty villagers is not really tense as much as it is irritating , and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train-wreck a little fun . could it be headed for cult-classic status ? where is mst3k when we need it ?",0,2
"perhaps you will not care for the social commentary , or the film makers point of view ( i myself am mystified at the insignificance' angle kasdan seemed to promote when clearly , the actions taken in the movie promote certain significance . the ending confused me ) . however , there is absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism throughout; the threaded character arcs; visuals; dialogue is absolute masterwork . i've watched the movie dozens of times , and i still marvel at its perfection . there's not a moment , action , cut , or line that does not have everything to do with the theme . realistic human performances from all the actors . scene to scene it is woven fantastically . i have a pretty level sap-meter . the buzzer never went off during this film . if you are a thinker ( rather than a casual viewer ) this movie delivers . exponentially . absolutely mesmerizing . ( do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display ? who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not , was it interesting ? ) personally , the movie affected me significantly . in my top 5 . note : the front-page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed african american perception . what he may have failed to recognize , is , there was a hand shake . not a hand - out . the spiritually dead white man' , simply saw a man to respect , and admire . and he did something about it . the fact he was black had little , if anything , to do with it ( color is simply used to draw the parallel . and the chasm . it's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either ) . if you view the blacks in this movie as token' you may want to reassess your angst . you may be seeing only black and white yourself , eh . just a thought .",1,10
"tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films . at two hours , it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed . mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a ""greatest hits"" performance with bits of mary the innocent , mary the little devil , mary the little mother , mary the spitfire , mary the romantic heroine , etc . characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past . the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question ! if the academy awards had been around in 1922 , no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's .",1,10
"this movie is written by charlie higson , who has before this done the ""legendary"" fast show and his own show based on one of fast show is characters ( tony the car sales man ) . he's also written james bond books for kids . actually i've seen before this only gordon's movies that are based on lovecraft's stories , and every one of those is marvelous . here gordon tries to do something different . the style is totally ""contemporary"" , which means shaky camera , fast and strange cutting , cool chillout music in the background . it works quite well here , i guess , but it is still pointless and cheap . it makes me often think of the cameraman who is shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures ( hoping that something tolerable would come out of it ) . the casting is good , and there is a whole atmosphere , which is the result of good directing . i think the main character , the ""zero"" young guy , is quite interesting in his ""zeroness"" . the fat guy is also good . and the guy who looks like alec baldwin , but is not him . but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting : in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness . there is not much humanity in this film/story : it's totally pessimistic , and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless , or soon dead . needless to say that there is no humor either . it's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment . anyway , gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today , and i think of this movie as an experiment , and as a failure in that . everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes , just to learn and to find their way again . this might be gordon's most uninteresting and empty work .",0,2
"this film is just plain horrible . john ritter doing pratt falls , 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards , poor editing , horrible sound mixing ( dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise ) , and a plot that really goes nowhere . i did not think i'd ever say this , but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film . there are at least 3 others that suck more . patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein . i started to wonder if she was not dead inside . even bogdanovich's kids are awful ( the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card ) . this movie is seriously horrible . there's a reason bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later . please do not watch it . if you see it in your television listings , cancel your cable . if a friend suggests it to you , reconsider your friendship . if your spouse wants to watch it , you are better off finding another soulmate . i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again . if i could sum this film up in one word , that word would be : suckotrocity",0,1
"when i saw this film on fearnet , i thought it would be a scary movie . apparently , it was not . i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site . fearnet is a site that shows scary horror movies . the acting is wonderful from all the actors . i hated the story . the story was stupid . the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it . he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen . the water turns to blood , the oceans die out , the moon turns red , etc . the female character was annoying as well . a lot of the stuff she did did not make sense . like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it . coincidentally , it is the date she is expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means . *spoiler alert* the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it . here's what happens . the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins . demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child . she touches her child's head , transferring her soul into the child and then dies . then , the apocalypse stops . why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart ? he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he is all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby ? *end spoiler* the movie is pretty stupid . it's another religious end of the world propaganda piece . the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent . that's about all there is . i give this movie 2 stars out of 10 . good acting with a lot of nonsense !",0,2

"john wayne & albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory , and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah , usa . an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting , with wayne & dekker playing the old and new factions of the west . it's based on a story by thomson burtis who co-writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill . albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career . a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third , where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse . the light hearted approach to the romantic strand does not sit quite right , and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work . but hey , stunt men deserve their moment of glory always . solid support comes from george 'gabby' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma , particularly when rattling off his pistol . but in spite of its better than usual republic budget , it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts . 4/10",0,4

"the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies . i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since . i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters , and if it was playing today i'd go out to see it again . now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads . matthau was brilliant , but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson's oscar winning performance of randall p . macmurphy in ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest . burns did win , though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well . even the smallest roles were played to perfection , like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial . which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film , the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross . ross who previously brought a two person play , ""the owl and the pussycat"" to the screen and made a full movie out of it , does it again . he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play . he fleashens out the story and the characters . here we are 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play , where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special . though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes , the sequence itself is totally new . a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall , which was wonderful . but i think that ross and screenwriter , playwright simon improved on it . it's just a wonderful film .",1,10
"i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations . i had seen jacquet's previous movie ( march of the penguins ) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio . however , i was severely disappointed . most of all , this movie is terribly boring . literally nothing happens . i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend , and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like ""well then the winter comes , and then spring , and then there is an eagle , and a river , and one time it is dark , and the girl goes into a cave , and another time the fox has babies"" and so on . after about half an hour i began sighing , yawning , rolling my eyes , cursing the reviewer at the radio station , and hoping that it would be over soon . but the movie went on and on . when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking . the most annoying parts of the movie are ( a ) the girl , who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with . she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie ( one year ) , and shows exactly two facial expressions : joy and seriousness . she is cute , no question about that . however , a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence . i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear , drown in the river , or something similarly terrible . ( b ) the commentary by the girl's adult voice , which tells us nothing but negligible , obvious , boring , redundant things . ( c ) the music , which is desperately lacking subtlety . when the girl is happily jumping around , the music jumps around , too . when the fox is threatened by an eagle , the music becomes threatening , too . it reminded me of the very early days of film-making , and was just too predictable to enjoy . admittedly , many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it , at least they got somehow involved . thus , my warning concerns adults only : if you are over ten years old , avoid this movie . you can get a better ( and cheaper ) sleep in most other places .",0,3

"i still have grainy , late night , no-cable , cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when , late-night-commercials and all , when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on -- just so i could tape it . the series was not really about freddy kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serling-esquire announcer . instead , each episode was a distinct nightmare , using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood , dating , cannibalism , dating , money , death , dating , and . . . hmm . . . dating . from the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says ""i will love you forever"" to the wrong girl , and is stuck with her ( literally , at least for a moment , they grow together . . . ) , to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man , only to find herself in his cabin , where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses , and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey ( and the injuries and penalties that go with it ) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series . one episode had jeffrey combs ( re-animator , etc . ) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient . not original , but still creepy and fun . . . . even so , some of the episodes were great . my personal favorite was ""it's a miserable life"" where a young man is trapped working in his parents' burger joint , when he wants to go off to college . stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same . no , not freddy , just a thug with a gun - turns out the whole mind-blowing episode is just that - the last thoughts that pass through the kid's head . . . along with a bullet . the second half of the same episode ( many of the freddie's nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories ) followed his girlfriend , who was also wounded , but not killed in the drive-by , and who is taken to ""the hospital from heck"" - they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clich s , and then some - from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut - or waking up during an operation - to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle . again , that was my favorite . some of the episodes were much dumber , like almost all of the ones they've made available on video . they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series , and then nobody likes them , thinks the show stunk , and then they do not put any more on video . it's a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england - but i'm still gonna buy it .",1,8
"high energy raoul walsh classic from 1933 , the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy , george raft , with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry . it's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about , but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids . plenty of wisecracks at the beginning , but the characters soften up as the film progresses . apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery's saloon . the various characters , sexy chorus line , lots of drinking , a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so-called pre-code restrictions , and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself . it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that is long gone . i do not like to compare eras , but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today . the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see .",1,10
"my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer , today a writer and journalist , has put forward the theory that , just as british film-makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called ""thatcher's britain"" , the ealing comedies were intended as satires on ""attlee's britain"" , the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election . this theory was presumably not intended to apply to , say , ""kind hearts and coronets"" ( which is , if anything , a satire on the edwardian upper classes ) or to ""the ladykillers"" or ""the lavender hill mob"" , both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature . it can , however , be applied to most of the other films in the series , especially ""passport to pimlico"" . pimlico is , or at least was in the forties , a predominantly working-class district of london , set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station . it is not quite correct to say , as has often been said , that the film is about pimlico ""declaring itself independent"" of britain . what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy . this means that , technically , pimlico is an independent state , and has been for nearly five hundred years , irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants . the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly , but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply . because pimlico is not subject to british law , the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please , unhindered by the rationing laws . when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets , the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black-marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the ""burgundians"" , as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves , to surrender . many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system , either as an individual as happens in ""the man in the white suit"" or ""the lavender hill mob"" , or as part of a larger community as happens in ""whisky galore"" or ""the titfield thunderbolt"" . the central theme of ""passport"" is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government-imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties . the film's particular target is the rationing system . during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism , but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime . it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 , and organisations such as the british housewives' league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing . i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the ""spivs"" ( black marketeers ) , who play a relatively minor part in the action , or the housewives' league , who do not appear at all . the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats , who are portrayed either as having a ""rules for rules' sake"" mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all . i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino . ( indeed , i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film ) . in 1949 , however , four years after the end of the war , the film-makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity , so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain . one of the best-known lines from the film is ""we always were english and we always will be english and it is just because we are english that we are sticking up for our right to be burgundians"" . there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense , tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico , all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics . most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave , but in the last scene , after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain . global warming may have altered things slightly , but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief , whatever statistics might say to the contrary , that britain had an abnormally wet climate . the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important . there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton , the grocer and small-time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico , and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor . in the main , however , this is , appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together , an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film . it lacks the ill-will and rancour of many more recent satirical films , but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that . it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and , with the possible exception of ""kind hearts and coronets"" is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies . 10/10",1,10

"titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies . it has its problems ( what movies do not ) but still , it is enjoyable . when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic , i suppose my first reaction is ""wait a minute , you do not ? "" i know so many people who do not like this movie , and i'm not saying i do not see why . ""the love story is too cheesy"" well , yes but is not it enjoyable and moving ? all right , the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic , everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist . but this is a movie , does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while ? the next complaint , dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors . well , ok , in this movie , i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials . however i think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors . i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in . but the roles they are given are simple , and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit , but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected . and finally , if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance , or because they hate history , or tragic movies , then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things . it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies . simply for being a movie , not because you dislike the genre , this is a good movie . well deserving of its oscars , in particular , best cinematography , which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy . i know some of the writing fails , such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie . the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times , but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real , and the sinking feel so epic . i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie , but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea , such as it being a love story , rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed . i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic , including memoirs form the day it happened , and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults . the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper , not steel , and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it . i give this movie 10/10 , not because i like romance movies , but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement , that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .",1,10
"after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick . the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah . here director duo abbas-mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures . they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood . but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama . hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salman's colleague in her apartment , salman slapped him . the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song , story , casting , performances etc . which are required to make a movie hit . but of course for salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him . why ? because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la-la-la all around . his role as a rich young businessman who has no-nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive . after all madhubala , a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing . later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention . her facial expressions and body language become more attractive , and focus mainly goes to her . her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that heart-touching as it is here . of course , this can be termed as improvement . then priya , a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result . she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preity . finally , the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself . in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother . perhaps , many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret . and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives . but still then it is a doubt .",1,10
"great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt's character interviewing the president , or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us . scenes like those would have kept the audience awake . cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those . the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching . also , big fans of fising , early 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well . . . . . . . .",1,10
"although i've long been a fan of peter weir , i had not watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave . and it was a pleasant , unpredictable surprise . richard chamberlain plays david , a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine . for david's peers it is a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence . but david believes there is a mystery underneath the murder , linked to tribal rituals . as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too . to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen . i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting . there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie : chamberlain's acting , for instance; but also the performances by david gulpilil , who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries; and nandjiwarra amagula , who plays an old aborigine who is a spiritual guide . the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie . but there is also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie . david has dreams that warn him of the future . australia is undergoing awful weather , with storms , hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution . but it is also related to the case david is defending . how it is related is one of the great revelations of the movie . out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression , suggesting future horrors without really showing anything . charles wain's score is fantastic , especially the use of the didgeridoo . the photography is also quite good . russell boyd , weir's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander , depicts a dark , creepy world full of mystery . i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines , it does not turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions , like dances with wolves or the last samurai . this movie is too clever to be that simplistic . sometimes it can be frustrating , and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who do not mind some strangeness or ambiguity , the last wave is a great movie to watch .",1,8
"a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script . ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel . i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed . there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either . watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying . spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible . he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero . it has to be a mysterious virus . after the inspector says this , the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony . this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel . end spoilers overall , this movie is extremely lame . i do not understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none . my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film . this is a movie to avoid .",0,4

"this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it is not on any of her collections . the reason why is probably because it does not have a happy ending , unlike all her other films . its also not a musical , although she does belt out one song called' the world owes me a living' . the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white , the version i have is in colour and on vhs , i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic , unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful . the film is good for its age and the story has not dated at all , i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake . at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out , in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five . although do not be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it , especially when {jerry}gary cooper steals a necklace , and hides it in shirley's teddy bear . the tension and slow build up to his actions , {while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directed . gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good . in all this is a good film from the early 30's , accept it for its age .",1,8

"tom brown's schooldays aspect ratio : 1 . 78 : 1 sound format : stereo in late 19th century england , young tom brown ( alex pettyfer ) is sent to the public school at rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster ( stephen fry ) and stands up to the school's resident bully , flashman ( joseph beattie ) . already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably gordon parry's superior 1951 version - thomas hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment , courtesy of screenwriter ashley pharoah ( tv's ""where the heart is"" ) and director david moore ( the forsyte saga ) . it's pleasant enough , and watchable , but it is also rather staid and dull , distinguished only by fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions' , and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old pettyfer , a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to hollywood and beyond . otherwise , this is typical uk tv fodder , the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product , even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this . the uk publication 'radio times' described it as ""daintily odd"" and raised a querulous eyebrow over ""all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome , rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys"" . quite .",0,4

"this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations . there are constant references to assembly line production , where workers are treated as cogs in a machine , overseen by managers wielding clipboards , controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed , and firing workers ( stanley ) who meet all criteria ( as his supervisor says , are always on time , are hard workers , do good work ) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake . this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home ( where he quickly dies ) after stanley loses his job . iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant . references are made to the fact that now , with declining wages , both partners need to work , the implication being that there is nobody left at home to care for the kids . iris' husband is dead from an illness , and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care , the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care . iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job ( even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them ) . the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail ( presumably , he is also black , and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates ) . she remarks that he , like her , ""is doing time"" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave . stanley , however , still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism . he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract , as iris' brother in law does ( suggesting that he ""married the wrong sister"" ) . he does not , as iris says , conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather , he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way , in a sort of bauhaus ideal . this was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists ( such as the bauhaus ) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs , allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations . he is also outside of traditional gender relations . he cooks , he cleans , he cares for his family , and he knows how to iron . iris , on the other hand , lives in a traditionally male role - she is a factory worker , the mains source of income for her ( extended ) family , and she brings stanley into the public realm , traditionally off-limits to women . by teaching him to read and write , she gives him access to the world of knowledge , also traditionally gendered male . literacy here is used as a metaphor for the ( traditionally masculine ) public realm and the systems of circulation ( monetary , vehicular , cultural ) that enable participation in the public realm . without this access , stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning . he is excluded from all regular circulations , unable to participate in the monetary ( cannot open a bank account ) , in the vehicular ( cannot get a driver's license , cannot ride the bus ) , and in the social ( he asks if he exists if he cannot write his name ) . after learning to read , he grabs books on auto repair , farming , and spirituality ( the bible ) . the word of god is therefore relativized , placed on the same value plane as how-to books . in fact , organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex . it is , however , acknowledged as a moral force - iris , clearly a character devoted to living a ""good"" life , mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching . once able to read , he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan , a car , and a house , taking his place at the head of the family , the breadwinner . presumably , he is an industrial designer , dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce . this ending , probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film , is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it was not forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line . now that , according to the pundits , we have comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism , the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel , as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period . nevertheless , it is highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain . disregard the ending , and it is close to a perfect 10 .",1,9

"" people are expendable , especially africans , and there does not seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes . there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . apparently one of weismuller's friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not maureen o'sullivan . she , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . they still do not need to talk a lot . they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . no wonder they are happy .",1,7
"this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i've ever seen on screen . andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction . he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good sense . his purity , honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art . i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end . sometimes prematurely , but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly . the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy's art has . it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself . fred frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound . this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect . it has no boundaries as far as age goes .",1,10

"sadly i do not remember the book anymore , but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace . this film represents a typical german production of low quality . it does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good , it is just badly adabted . at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances . even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle . however there is hope . . . i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better . so in conclusion i must say that this film does not deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon .",0,3
"tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) was the only tarzan movie i did not see when i was a kid . it sounded boring . now i have seen it . i have seen the ape man ( 1932 ) about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive . it's a remarkable movie . it's almost flawless . tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) however , falters . it's not harmonic and it is parts tend to live a life of there own . the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great . big budget expensive . tarzan himself is co-starring . jane dominates . she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead . well . she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant . she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father . forever . the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle . stupid ? later someone founds it in the river . well it is supposed to proof tarzan is dead . some cheap drama . the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone . she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away ( to england ) . stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is , how hard he is to kill . the caravan is leaving and jane go along . again a pothole . she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more , to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband . she could be smart . she could dive where they found the floating bracelet , check the banks for traces . she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's . picking up traces should not be too hard for jungle jane . she could talk to the apes , and so on . if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable . jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down . and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with ""i blame myself as much as you"" . a punishment for being vane perhaps ? nonsense . struggle , a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate . still . this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep . just lean back and enjoy . it's tarzan and jane for god sake .",1,7
"engaging , riveting tale of captured us army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman . paul ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea . in the vein of classic courtroom dramas , ""sergeant ryker"" is an extremely well crafted mystery , ably guided by an outstanding cast , director kulik's constant momentum , and effective plot twists and turns . this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 , and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many ""name"" actors , and some action sequences . dillman , reprising his role , is spot-on as the doubting defence attorney , whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of ryker's supportive , yet somewhat distant wife , played with aplomb by vera miles . rounding out the frontline is peter graves for the prosecution , and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles . marvin's interpretation of the paul ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed . marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference , to passionate determination , giving a convincing , often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama . it's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever lists of courtroom dramas . however , despite its apparent obscurity , ""sergeant ryker"" still remains a taut and compelling examination , like a book that you just cannot put down . highly recommended .",1,8
"corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr . alan feinstone , a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection . when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems , feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend . director brian yuzna , working from a suitably dark , witty and demented script by stuart gordon , dennis paoli , and charles finch , exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well-manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee . moreover , yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor . bernsen positively shines as dr . feinstone; he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that is right beneath feinstone's deceptively calm and assured veneer . the supporting cast are likewise excellent : linda hoffman as feinstone's bitchy , unfaithful wife brooke , earl boen as smarmy , meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum , molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica , patty toy as perky assistant karen , jan hoag as jolly office manager candy , virginya keehne as sweet , gawky teenager sarah , ken foree as thorough , no-nonsense detective gibbs , tony noakes as gibbs' equally shrewd partner detective sunshine , michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt , and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers . the first-rate make-up f/x are every bit as gory , gross and upsetting as they ought to be . the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom-in close-ups . alan howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh-crawling spot . an enjoyably warped treat .",1,8
"whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration . if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro-americans in georgia , such as shown in this film , obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there . it is rather hypocritical , to say the least , if everyone adores halle berry , whoopie goldberg , beyonc , noemi campbell , denzel washington , will smith , et . al . , whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides . white grandmother suddenly gets black grand-daughter thrust upon her , only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater . the story is sweet , not lacking tragic overtones , and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films , though the final scene has you guessing . . . . . . . . . . . . will he ? will not he . . . . . . . ? gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering , and louis gossett is a good match for her; the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show . a `nice' way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much , though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it .",0,4

"this is an excellent , fast paced thriller by wes craven ( nightmare on elm street ) , who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings . we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger , and cillian murphy ( batman begins ) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable , friendly , even charismatic killer . the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams ( claire , from the wedding crashers ) are brilliant . most of the film takes place on a very intimate level , between two people , their eyes , their faces . it is action on a small scale , not the broad sweep of the canvas , and it is no less compelling for these limitations . the cinematography is nothing special , though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet , but the dialog is excellent , the story taut . there are no distractions , no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters . by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions , wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting , fast-paced action thriller .",1,9
"we bought the dvd set of ""es war einmal das leben"" ( german ) / ""once upon a time . . . life"" ( english ) for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the ""es war einmal der mensch"" ( german ) / ""once upon a time . . . man"" ( english ) series ( us parents had seen it as kids ) and it has exceeded even high expectations ! the series is very well made , does not show its age , and our kids at various ages really like to watch it . at the same time , they learn things us parents did not know until way , way later . the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs , all senses , blood , infection , antibodies , and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes . topics some people may find ""sensible"" , such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful , discreet and child-friendly manner ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing ) , while still ( as typical ) informative and fun . children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment . the format of the episodes switches between the outside world ( a family with 2 children ) and the inside of the body . for example , in the episode covering infections , the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this . similarly , the episodes on the senses , e . g . hearing , seeing , link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including ( briefly ) where the oxygen comes from ( plants ) . this is one of the best ever children's programs - i would say it is a must see for every family with kids !",1,9
"yes , this production is long ( good news for bronte fans ! ) and it has a somewhat dated feel , but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you will not want to watch any other versions ! timothy dalton is edward rochester . . . it is that simple . i do not care that other reviewers claim he is too handsome . dalton is attractive , certainly , but no pretty-boy . in fact he possesses a craggy , angular dark charm that , in my mind , is quite in keeping with the mysterious , very masculine mr r . and he takes on rochester's sad , tortured persona so poignantly . he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it , but also displays rochester's tender , passionate , emotional side as well . ( imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout . i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast . ) when i reread the novel , i always see zelah clarke as jane . ms . clarke , to me , resembles jane as she describes herself ( and is described by others ) . small , childlike , fairy . . . though it is true the actress does not look 18 , she portrays jane's attributes so well . while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional , one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and ""passionate nature"" in check . her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen , who was the picture of demure submission . although her true nature was dissimilar , jane learned to master her temper and appear docile , in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service' . jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr . rochester . she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal . even later on when she gave as well as she got , she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer . nevertheless , if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered . the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right , i think . no , it does not in the least resemble hollywood ( thank god ! it's not a hollywood sort of book ) but theirs is a romance which is true , devoted and loyal . and for a woman like jane , who never presumed to have *any* love come her way , it is a minor miracle . the rest of the casting is terrific , and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here . so , too , is much of the rich , poetic original dialogue . this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely , infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general , features more humor than other versions i've seen . in particular , the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful ! jane eyre was , in many ways , one of the first novelized feminists . she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently , and , at last , as rochester's true equal . just beautiful !",1,10

"sometimes , lady luck smiles on me . i had originally made -- and copied over -- a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation . i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else . recently , i subscribed to digital cable , and while searching through upcoming movies , there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie . this time , however , i made a copy of it to dvd so there is no chance of repeating my mistake . i finally got to watch it again after eight years , and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it . there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with ""pandora's clock"" came with a live reading of the book on public radio . i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch , and from the first installment , i was hooked . each day , i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read . when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie , i made sure to clear my schedule for that event . first of all , i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book , contrary to what another reviewer had said . that , in itself , is a rare achievement for tv movies . secondly , i agree with others about the casting . i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson . literally , the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role . anderson has never been better , and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him . in fact , all of the cast members did a superb job . my only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the ""terrorist plot"" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane . basically , we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one , and folks , that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved . also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one , then two of its engines blown off . that beef aside , i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film , as well as our own . if you have an opportunity to see this movie , do so by all means .",1,10
"""godzilla vs king ghidorah"" is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo-patriotism . here , travellers from the future try to ruin japan , replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster , the three-headed golden dragon king ghidorah . they fail , however and in the end godzilla fights ghidorah . the battles between the two behemoths are very cool , but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about ""japan is great"" is really stupid . the creators of this movie did not even threat with respect the enemies of japan , making them stupid big blond guys , who are easily outsmarted by the clever japanese . the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king ghidorah nearly destroyed the both japan and it is ridiculous enemies in one ( actually two ) spectacular combats . but till this battle royale , the film was really dull and pathetic .",0,4

"probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life , and i enjoyed it . the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i . e . mozambique , angola , and guinea ( bissau ) - cape vert . most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of caetano's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including spinola , who took over as the new president . the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .",1,8
"eytan fox , whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics , has made several quite interesting films in the past such as ""walk on water"" and the simply wonderful film , ""yossi & jagger"" . in ""the bubble"" , however , he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme . far from giving this film a standing ovation , the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left . i also quietly left , fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying , and racist bullying ( and terrorism ) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided israeli aggression against them , and that they , therefore , should not be held responsible for their actions . this film was not worth the money i paid for the ticket ( indeed , i considered demanding my money back ) , and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film ""paradise now"" . if you want to be an anti-israeli , then by all means watch this film , as it really justifies just such a belief system . the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and , even worse , such a talented israeli director , is a crying shame . indeed , just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti-israel propaganda , beggars belief . what a shameful , horrid little film !",0,1

"i'm sure that the folks on the texas/louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public . very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war . no big cattle empires there , they are much farther west in texas , farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire . the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle , they keep the cattle . and that is the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start . along the way foster marries dix's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors . they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo . anyway , us easterners who like westerns usually do not bother with geographical trifles and it is still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount . the climax is a blazing , and i mean that literally , gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production . but i would not have any but western fans look at it .",0,4
"as an avid fan of cary grant , i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter , as amc billed it as a comedy . i have never been more disappointed with a film ! cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie; he comes across as strained , bored , and just not himself . mississip's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated ( and incorrect , according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from ) , and whenever he does deliver a line , it is several decibels higher than any other cast member . mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable , country-bumpkin goofball , but in the end , he manages only to detract from the already weak plot . mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a hollywood sex kitten , and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability , this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with . ray walston's character was sugary and ultimately contrived . for four men on shore leave , it was the tamest leave i've ever seen . i watched this nightmare until its very end , and while i will not spoil that for anyone , i will tell you that it is the most absurd you will ever see . the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men , but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast . sorry , cary !",0,1

"actually i liked this movie very , very much . not because of it`s plot , acting , jokes , no . i liked it , because it`s one of the worse movies ever created . it`s so lame , so bad , that it becomes terribly funny . some jokes are actually cool , but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter . ""men in white"" are so dumb and stupid , that you can do only two things . turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing ( beer helps a lot : ) . i chose the second option .",1,10

"i cannot believe john died ! while filming an episode he collapsed on set ! read this , ( out of his biography online ) : john ritter was born in burbank , calafornia , on september 17th 1948 . he landed his last television role in ""8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter"" ( 2002 ) , based on the popular book . on this sitcom , he played paul hennessey , a loving , yet rational dad , who laid down the ground rules for his three children . the show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a peoples choice award for best new comedy and also won for favorite comedy series by the family awards ! while working ""8 simple rules"" , he also starred in his second-to-last film , manhood ( 2003 ) that same year , while john was rehearsing for the 4th ( 3rd series ) episode of 8 simple rules ( now shortened ) , he fell ill . henry winkler described it as ""john looked like he had food poisoning"" . then he collapsed on the set , he was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital , the same burbank hospital where he was born , he was diagnosed with an aorta dissection , an unrecognized heart flaw , he underwent surgery but did not make it . john ritter died at age 54 , just 1 week away from his 55th birthday , leaving his wife amy yasbeck and 4 children .",1,10
"when i was younger , i thought the first film was really good in childhood , so i decided to see the sequel . this is an example of why some films should not have sequels , because the first film is usually best , and it is . basically now that ariel and eric are married they have a daughter who is not allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of ursula ( the octopus legged villain from film one ) , morgana getting to her . when the kid gets out she asks ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid , like her mum was . this makes ariel go back to the sea to find her . the same good voice artists , it is just the story that could have had a bit more thought . adequate !",0,3
"i do not know what that other guy was thinking . the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible . you can be as big a believer as you want . . . the majority of this film is mindless drivel . i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it . and that alone was no small feat . not only is the acting terrible , but the plot is never even close to developed . there are countless holes in the story , to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore . i've never read the book , so i cannot critique on that , but this is the first review that i've written here and it is purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life . i cannot remember the last time i could not even finish watching a movie . this one really takes the cake .",0,2
"when you look at this now and hear all the language in here , it is amazing this was rated ""pg , "" but that is the 1970s rating system for you . peter falk spews out the lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie ! yet , few people consider that offensive , and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who ""rate"" them . the cast is a clue to how profane this film can be : falk , peter boyle , allen garfield , warren oates , gena rowlands and paul sorvino are not exactly actors you would not find in ""the sound of music . "" i like heist movies , and a lot of films by director william friedkin , but this script does not deliver and it just has way too much of the ""sleazy '70s"" feel to it , visually and audibly . for those who loved falk in tv's ""columbo"" it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films . this is far from the only case .",0,2
"this is a pleasant film , even if the premise is silly . it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch . meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film ( another example is joe vs . the volcano ) . that's what makes her a star , in part . walter matthau , of course , had that ability , too , and he really puts himself into the role , making an amusing , good-hearted einstein . i suppose you could say they are both good at portraying loveable characters , though loveable in different ways ( loveable young women vs . loveable curmudgeon ) .",1,7
"i just want to make one thing clear- i love michael vartan ! but this film really lets him down . his acting is still superb , he is still as charming as ever , and he still looks great . but the film itself is a load of rubbish ! natasha henstridge , i'm sorry to say it , comes over bit manly . . . you are constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend , who is own sub-storyline is a little weird . myself and my family ( who sat down and watched the film with me ) were also put off by the soundtrack to the film; at times the music just did not fit with what was going on in the scenes . however , even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film . i could forgive the leading lady's butch-ness , i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix , and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment , but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end ? ? ? the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold . if you are a michael vartan fan skip this film : buy yourself a poster instead .",0,2
"""men of honor"" - true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver ( fabulous cuba gooding jr . ) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema . wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable , splendid experience . charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough , fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday - role is practically written for him . this film alongside with fantastic ""15 minutes"" ( 2001 ) are two of the latest proofs that he is still one of the very finest actors of our time . on the other hand ""men of honor"" includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr . who has been one of the most promising young black actors since ""boyz n the hood"" . ""men of honor"" goes straight into the company of ""jerry maguire"" , ""as good as it gets"" and ""instinct"" . cuba gooding jr . is a skillful and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him . ""men of honor"" has also quite an excellent story-line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history . this is a great , fascinating movie and i can only recommend it .",1,8
"this is a very good , made for tv film . it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around . the worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog . the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family . but boy ! , does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end . the father/homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is . he stands up to them and protects his home and his family . a very good actor . . i might add . i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 . i have never seen it again on tv and would like to . definitely a good one ! it's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and cannot stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend . it's the kind they just do not show anymore . it is definitely worth seeing !",1,10

"inspector gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon . i enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's christmas special ""inspector gadget saves christmas"" . some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season ( 1985 ) of the show , but they need to compare it to dic's 2002 release of ""inspector gadget's last case : claw's revenge"" for then , they will find the second season to be absolute gold . being a gadget fan , i could not resist the opportunity to see the animated inspector gadget in something that was not gadget boy-related . i purchased the film , and i swore to myself that i'd be objective; i knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series . i was not even prepared for what i was about to watch . there was barely a shred of the original show still intact . here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie : *the humor is non-existent from the original series . *penny and brain ( originally having a nearly equal part in the series as gadget ) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals . *the original music by saban & levy is not there , and the score that exists is sub-par . ( understood that saban has his own production company now , but at least ""inspector gadget saves christmas"" had good music , even without saban . ) *don't expect to see any of gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing , such as gadget-copter , gadget-brella , gadget-mallet , gadget-coat ( which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing ) , as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets . in this movie , his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs . that kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show , and simply are not necessary to change . *the gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast-talking , supposedly ""hip"" convertible . all the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa . *chief quimby is now very short-tempered and even mean to gadget . he was always grumpy in the original series , but this pushes the situation a bit much . *penny no longer has a computer book . are there any positives to this movie ? ok , here goes . . . *maurice lamarche does a good job of taking over for the great don adams as inspector gadget . *in one scene , chief quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series : the great wambini ( classic ""gadget"" villain from the second season , voiced by louis nye ) . looking for more redeeming factors for this movie ? well , you are out of luck . life is about making choices and living by those choices . most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson . the lesson learned here : keep to the original formula ! ""if it am not broke , do not fix it . "" true gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed . hopefully , dic and shout ! factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of ""inspector gadget : the original series , volume 1 , "" containing the first 22 episodes of the series . as a true gadget fan , lover of 80's animation and many of dic's programs , i urge you the viewer to purchase ""inspector gadget : the original series , volume 1"" and ""inspector gadget saves christmas"" dvd's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories .",0,1
"i'm dumbfounded . yes that is right . i'm really caught here . no way did i find it awful , but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency . the idea behind such a trim , minimal low-budget indie production is not bad , but it is a confused muddle and in the end did not do anything for me . it's amateurish and simple; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of-late fashionably rapid filming style . we have the documentary laced ( hand-held ) camera moving everywhere ( despite never leaving the van ) , and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out . lately you kind of get use to it , but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating . keeping it still will help . the context has little groundwork ( which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads . at a road-side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight . scared , they flee and not too long that one-light suv appears behind them . soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror ) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out , noisy and relentless cat and mouse game . as for being disturbing i guess that depends . some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain , desperation and demented brutality ( with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects ) , but also i found myself snickering too . in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush , but hardly believable . the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe , despite obviously they should be . watch how blood runs freely , but it is not entirely convincing and can get dull . the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive . we get screaming , spewing , bleeding , running , cursing , body fluids and so on . quite unpleasant details followed too . with little really to do , it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up . too many cringe-moments arose from it , and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in . it was about set-pieces , waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough . helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern . the performances; jennifer barnett , angela brunda , danielle lilley , sandra paduch and mia yi are workman-like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its character-foundation . veronica garcia's flipped-out , bug-eyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was something yeah something . her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non-existent . i guess being psychotic was good enough . now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack . terrible techno music , to cheesy hard-rock and an overwrought closing score . it never felt overdone or got in the way , but it did stick out like a sore thumb . co-directors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources , but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle . maybe it was enjoyable to make , but watching it just was not the case .",0,4
"this is , by all categories , the best movie i have ever seen . forget hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art ! moon child's story starts with kei - a japanese vampire , who loathes what he has become and lives in denial . his wish for final death leads him to mallepa , where refugees from several asian countries live . here , he meets sho , an orphan living on the street . from here , the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie . it has everything; you laugh , you cry , you get angry , excited , sad , happy . . . never has a movie touched me the way this movie do . and the actors are amazing - never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange . a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece . . . a last comment on this brilliant movie , is that it stars gackt ( ex-vocalist of malice mizer ) and hyde ( vocalist of l'arc~en~ciel ) in excellent roles as sho and kei . i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out . this is a must see . if you never see any films , see moon child , the crow ( brandon lee ) and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii - advent children . all in their original languages , of course !",1,10
"imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason , but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68 . doesn't really matter , except that it is quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video ( one of the first art works to merge the two apparently ) in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 , released the same year . pure abstraction is not really my thing , but i can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers , rohrschach blots , birds , etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful . certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s , and deserves to be better known .",1,8

"ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from ? according to 'jake speed' they are based on real people , living out the adventures they write about and publish . this movie is quality family entertainment , moderate amounts of violence , and skimpy clothes at the worst . the language is is also not a problem , and the jokes are funny at all levels . this is a 'austin powers' look at 'indian jones' , without the over-the-top antics of michael myers . i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range .",1,8

"! ! ! ! ! possible spoiler ! ! ! ! ! you`d think a story involving archie grey owl - an englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . in fact i`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama . worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony ( played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native american . the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman - that`s why i wrote "" possible spoiler "" it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved . yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green ( and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor",0,3
"i've seen this film criticized with the statement , ""if you can get past the moralizing . . . "" that misses the point . moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder , as it were . this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery , but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through . the resolution leaves the viewer wondering , ""what would i have done in this position ? "" and i have to believe that is exactly what the filmmaker intended . to that end , and to the end of entertaining the audience , the film succeeds . i also like the way that the violence is never on stage , but just off camera . we know what has just happened; it is just not served up in front of us , then rubbed in our faces , as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing . besides , the violence is not the point . the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma , which is cleverly , albeit disturbingly , resolved .",1,8
"what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both . there really are not many glimpses of hope in this film for either character , but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other . this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well . the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns , though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors , including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film . also , for those interested , andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene . if you have not seen this movie , it is essential . check it out .",1,9
